inserting a burning stick deep into its well. After putting away my work and

faithfully curl up on my chest and stare at the candle's flickering shadows

blanket up over my waist and stare at the same flickering shadows upon the
ceiling. The wick would drown itself within an hour, about the time I'd doze
off, and Sister would begin prowling around the study, roaming past every wall

on my rear end. It felt like she was a stranger's hand, and I couldn't relax
until she moved up onto the middle of my back. It was harder to breathe but it
felt good having her there. She purred loudly sending warm vibrations up my

bell rang at eight before doing my business and preparing the library for the

or to simple ignore it&#8212;this dreadful routine that's become too real and
personal. But it sat up beside me like a ghost and followed me around the study

the bathroom and looked at ourselves in the mirror. We watched in the

time, and I'm certain that as a result his days became progressively more
glorious as the week advanced. Sister and I still lack this ability. What we

mud and rain splattered against the flowers, weighing down the lower leaves,
forcing them into the mud. The plants soaked up as much water as they could,
but the rain grew in strength and mass and soon drowned the drooping leaves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

eventually fell. Like miniature bombs, they pelted the flowers and snapped the
thinnest stems like dry sticks. Some blossoms frayed in the wind and dropped
onto the soil. They floated over the edge of the barrel while other leaves and
petals were pinned beneath dirt clods not dissolved by the fall. At last I
imagined a surge of bubbles rising from the puddle, carrying the plants' last
breath up and out of the mud, into the open air. The punishment was obscene and
relentless, and I instinctively checked to see if Sister was still indoors,
still safely crouched beneath the telephone stand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

shut and locked the screen but left the glass door open just enough to let some
outside air whistle into the kitchen. The house was dark, lit only by the light
above the stove. The ceiling fan above the table hummed and ticked rhythmically
as the blades spun overhead. Mangan's Sister still hid under the telephone
stand, her eyes just as wide and alert as when the thunder started. She reacted
to this storm no differently than she had to others until a thunder clap
knocked out a power line. The stove light blinked once and went out. The hum
from the ceiling fan stopped&#8212;only the ticking remained, one tick following more
slowly another and another until the ticking skipped a beat and then another
and then stopped eventually altogether. And then it returned: the jarring
silence, the sibilant static of nothing. So I sat at the table stuck in the
kitchen's bizarre vacuum, waiting for the hum of the refrigerator to convince
me that my house was still living.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

soft meow came from the corner and blew into the kitchen, interrupting the
stillness. Suddenly I was hungry and remembered that a half pint of strawberry
ice cream remained in the back of the freezer. It had just began to soften and
so I hoped to seduce Mangan's Sister out from under the telephone stand by
waving a spoonful in front of her. It didn't work. After the first attempt, I
sat at the table and mashed up the ice cream with a soup spoon, slurping the
mush straight from the carton like it were a milkshake still in its stainless
steel fratcan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and then lightning glared through the windows, and within each flash, I could
see the sallow glow of the toaster oven, the pitcher of dried chrysanthemums,
the postcards on the freezer door, the half-empty spice rack, my juice glass
from breakfast and the cereal box still opened beside the sink. Each flash
drained everything of color and gave everything in exchange an eerie shadow.
The gray light made the room look pale and frozen. Fixtures throughout the
house had the same pale and frozen expression as the victims of Pompeii: frozen
instantly in death; dying within the space of a flash, passing away between strides
to the market, between spoonfulls of supper and sips of cool water, between
sentences, phrases and pauses. Everything in my kitchen was caught in a
chilling tableau, stuck within my mind like some strange, subliminal therapy
meant only to excite and surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wind blew harder through the sliding-glass door and rain made its way through
the screen, spraying the floor and the edge of the kitchen table. But I paid it
no attention. I sat instead at the table, still sipping my ice cream and
watching within the lightning the pale apparitions of my kitchen's furnishings.
The mimosa had been knocking at the upstairs window for some time but I ignored
it until I heard the window pop open and felt the wind rushing down the stairs,
through the living room and into the kitchen. Curtains in front of the bay
window flapped; a time or two the hem snapped like a wet sail. I bumped against
the table when I finally stood up and slipped on the wet floor. I skidded along
the wall past Mangan's Sister, nearly derailing on her tail waving from under
the telephone stand. I grabbed the back of the couch, regained some balance and
then dried my feet on the rug by skipping past the living room and up the
stairs to the studio. Once I reached the top, lightning projected ghoulish
patterns against the props and fixtures unique to the studio.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

objects cloaked in black sheets and covers looked taller and more human every
time the lightning flashed. The easel in the center of the room stood just a
little taller than the average female. The muslin sheet hung over the top like
hair and blew in the rainy wind as though it had just been washed; as though a
luminous lover had just stepped out of the shower and stood naked in front of
me. And every time the lightning strobed, the apparition appeared to move
closer. But I just stood there pressed into the doorway, unable or unwilling to
move. I searched for an outline or dimension by which I could gauge the
apparition's movement and distance. I searched in the darkness for some outstanding
feature, wanting to recognize who I wanted to see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mimosa's perfume drifted into the room like smoke while the rain sprayed
through the window, spinning into tiny twisters and framing the apparition in a
glowing mist. I wanted to step forward, to raise my arm and to touch it, but,
no longer fearing its presence, I feared instead that the figure would
disappear once I extended my hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that night, my visions of the artist occurred in a place or dimension that
couldn't detect me, a place where I wasn't seen or known. But for that moment
in the storm I was recognized. I was as familiar to her as were the fixtures in
her room. But I was unable to touch her. I was frozen somewhere I didn't belong
as if I were standing on my porch in <st1:City w:st="on">
        <st1:place w:st="on">Pompeii</st1:place>
    </st1:City>,
watching Vesuvius descending. I felt like I was trying to wake myself from a
dream, imagining an unbearable thirst that in consciousness I didn't have. I
was suddenly an invisible feature in my own dream, racked with a confusion that
disabled me from all feeling. I wanted the apparition to wake me before it was
over, before the storm passed away completely, before the lightning's erotic
pulsing sank into the dark distance, before the figure vanished into that
ethereal realm from where she came. But I knew that in spite of her absence,
her gentility, grace and humble sophistication would linger in the room long
after the storm had dissipated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

night for part of an hour time expanded. All references to reality changed in

figure in the center of the studio lost its ethereal charm when I finally moved
and turned around to close the window. The storm was its power; it was the
apparition's authority, and when it passed I knew the vision's significance to
reality had changed and I was no longer a part of the artist's existence&#8212;an
existence no more or less capricious than the weather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

house was still without power so I sat on the steps still stuck in the night's
queer vacuum. One by one I could hear the crickets beginning to speak and feel
the wind gusting through the sliding-glass door still ajar in the kitchen.
Sister mewed softly and I walked over to the telephone stand, stretched out on
the living room floor and responded just as softly. I rubbed her chin with a
finger and then rolled onto my back and whispered a few remembered lines from
an O'Neill one-act&#8212;the one about solitude and sky, sea and rain. The thunder
faded away and the rain eased up, dribbling in rhyme from the roof. Mangan's
Sister eased up a bit too and walked over to me in the living room. She curled
up between my neck and shoulder and purred just a little louder than the wind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
