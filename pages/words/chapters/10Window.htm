twenty miles east of the airport, into the mountains, a small hand-painted sign
announces the New Callia Springs &amp; Rock Shop: 1 mile. A small red arrow
points north onto Farm Road 13, a gravel road that ends at the advertised

was two days from Easter, the cusp of spring. I may have missed the season's
coming completely had I not been stranded on the mountain and forced to walk
that one mile to fetch water for my car. The road was narrow, and judging by

happened. Fernbush, huckleberry and western redbuds grew up on both sides of
the road, from small, shallow ditches on the road's east and west sides. <st1:State

was barely spring, and the branches and vines growing within the trees
stretched across the road, forming a tunnel of green. It couldn't have been

dropped a pursefull of coins. Wind passed lightly through the tunnel and
smelled incredibly fresh and fruity like strawberries or honeysuckle. The

pestilence we've been expecting will come in May and June with mayflies and
junebugs taking over the valley until man's devices kill them or they are eaten
by other species a leg up on the food chain. Nature's timing is merciless.
Immediately after laying eggs within the earth's folds and wrinkles, the
martyred parents slowly digest within other creatures or melt into the asphalt

acres of gardens and woodlands, kill or be killed over mating rights, consummate

warmest part of the day, and I was just warm enough under my jacket. The
temperature was a mild 70, or thereabouts. Above the canopy or out by the

shrubs around me. The leaning afternoon light leaked through the branches in
such a way that I felt like jogging. Deep measured breathing was the
afternoon's most sentient benefit. With air so pure and cool, every cell wanted
to feel it. Every fiber of muscle, sliver of bone, knot of gristle and strand
of hair wanted to breathe. It was like intercourse for every organ but one.

broke apart and the sunlight shone brightly onto the narrow road. A meadow
opened there and the urge to run overtook me and I began to run. I jogged
faster, feeling the air expanding within each lung. It moved through my chest
and down to my legs and feet that began on their own accord to run faster and
faster down the gradual hill. I pulled in as much air as possible through my
mouth and felt for a moment that I wouldn't make it to the clearing, to the
sunlight. Not since my youth have I run faster or with more passion than those
painfully addictive seconds through the tunnel of leaves to the open expanse of
springtime. My arms pumped faster with every stride longer than the one before,
my pace driven harder by nothing but impulse and pure, wet adrenaline. I must
have looked ridiculous dressed like a salesman I imagined, flailing a milk jug
against my hip feeling completely absorbed by the valences around me, above me
in the canopy and in the atomic spirit of the air itself. By the time I reached

were afflicted with a crop of ragweed. My spontaneity surprised me, it seduced
me in the burgeoning, blitzing, rushing optimism of spring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

meadow was ablaze with dandelions and cornflowers. There was hardly any grass

and leaned back on my elbows. Even in spite of the sunshine the ground was
refreshingly cool. The air blew in quick circles around me as it did within the

my shoulder and blowing off the petals that my boyish lungs left hanging on the

and the largest white oak that I have ever seen were shading an old well around

reminded me of the patico at the mission. The well I think was just a man-made

smell the valley. Perhaps the muse would come in a fragrance. I could hear the
wind moving faster, gusting like waves at the beach. Perhaps the muse would

waiting for the muse, I decided to get up and walk around the old place; but no
sooner than I stood up and turned toward the property, did a dozen or so
swallows fly up out of the well like a derrick gushing oil. The birds flew off
in tight formation around the giant white oak and over the rooftop of what may
have been the rock shop. Within a beat it was quiet again. Even the wind was
still; it followed the swallows around the tree and over the tiled roof. The
muse had come and gone before I could even say hello, introduce myself, ask a

I felt like a child pestering my father for the same favor again and again and

The back of the building was fenced in but I could see into the bathing area

the iron benches around the well still stood nearest the back wall where I
suspect the clubhouse and the locker rooms were. The tables were bare and dirty
but not as rusted as the benches around the well. I guess they were painted
more often. Several cast-iron chairs were strewn about in no apparent order,
all standing but one which was tipped forward with its legs sticking in the
air. The spring itself was nothing but a swimming pool, the standard 25 by 15
yard variety, but this one didn't slope in the middle, there was no end deeper
than the other. It looked like a giant wading pool made out of dark granite
slabs and no more than three or four feet deep at any point. I guess it was
built to simulate nature and to accommodate so many gallons of hot, spring
water and so many pounds of steeping bathers. I doubt there was much lap
swimming or any type of horseplay. But I'd have loved it here. I would have
dragged a cast-iron chair into the middle of the pool, strapped myself in to
keep from floating away, and just poach until I was completely relaxed, until
my vital signs were barely readable, until my strength oozed out of me leaving
me languid and lifeless as though I had just given birth to thirty pounds of
triplets. If I'd have stayed much longer, my skeleton would still be there
today in the dried up spa. Stranded motorists would see something strange
through the fence, come to investigate and find my remains strapped into the
rusted iron chair. They'd probably think I was tortured to death and that my
flesh had drowned and dissolved into the drain in the middle of the pool.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I guess its only natural to feel a bizarre intimacy before leaving a resting
place, knowing that you will never rest there again, that you will never notice
the same sandy patterns on a bench or a tiny spider that hung beside you from
the jut of a rooftop, that you'll never see the same tree against the same
sallow sunset or think the same thoughts within the same context that you did
under those conditions. Even loneliness is nostalgic when you depart from its
influence at times throughout your life. I guess being stranded, being broken

I wonder if my soul had a face, what would it look like. Would it resemble the
gargoyle that I sometimes see in the morning when I look into the mirror? And
would it then keep me from being who I am, being true to my nature, or would I
simply ignore it and withdraw deeper into my own world here in Valencia and end
up like the mayfly or the junebug stuck like a seed in the mud? Without seeing
the face of my soul, I wonder if my walks would have more or less meaning, if
being stranded on the highway would reveal different mysteries, if inspiration
would avoid me altogether or simply show me answers to other questions,
highlighting other aspects of my character that might lead me away from danger
even though it is danger itself that I am drawn to? What manner of death is
more peaceful or less certain than the one we choose for ourselves, the one we
anticipate while walking through a canopy of trees or yielding to a desire to
run, to flee, or giving in to the need to sleep, to sleep deeper than ever
before, deep enough to never wake up, to see the face of one's soul drowning,
voluntarily in a peaceful spring?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wonder if the moth knows that the light will kill it, or if the mayfly or the
junebug know their very nature is to suffer and die. They will forever die
following their own foolish natures, their own foolish inspirations. I should
be glad that man's nature is more noble than theirs, that the inspiration we
seek comes from more divine mysteries, for more divine objectives. And if the
inspiration that comes is according to our wishes, then maybe being stranded
along the highway or within Valencia is a fate worth knowing, a fate worth
wanting regardless of how often it leaves us stranded and alone. We would have
felt the depth of its wisdom. We would have felt its rush.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
