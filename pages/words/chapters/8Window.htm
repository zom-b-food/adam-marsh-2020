came early this afternoon, or so it seemed. I fell asleep at my desk and

the back of the chapel I could see my father smiling up at me and waving as if

away and I saw in his expression a heavy sadness that I remembered from my
childhood. He stood in his weekend blue jeans and t-shirt stained by a summer's
worth of yard work and raised a hand above his forehead as though he were
shading his eyes from the sun. He held that same frozen salute outside the
chapel in a variety of settings dredged up from my past. Sometimes I would see
him at the end of our driveway resting his forearm on the mailbox and gently
waving the screwdriver he used to scrape the motted grass from under the lawn
mower. And sometimes he'd be waving from the school playground or from the
federal building where he worked, where my mother and I would meet him some
afternoons for lunch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

father personalized melancholy and gave it a name and a face. He never
completely recovered from my mother's tiring illness and he resented her for
dying and her obsessive affair with vodka martinis and Marlboros. From his
constant scowl, you'd have thought she had a lover. But I guess in his eyes she
did. I can still remember quite vividly our last three years together as a
family and have yet to forget my father's worry and concern that permeated our
house. He would sit at the kitchen table and work the morning crossword while
keeping an eye on my mother lying on the couch in the living room. As my
mother's illness progressed she would spend more time in the bedroom with my
father kissing her forehead and holding her hand while she slept. I would
sometimes watch him from the hallway sitting beside her, gazing up at the
ceiling with that same aching expression. My father however failed to see that
the more my mother slipped away from him the more he slipped away from me. But
now that I am older I can see their relationship more clearly and how deeply
her suffering affected him. After she died, he gave up the crosswords
altogether and spent much of the day at the kitchen table looking up at the
ceiling or out the window. I can only guess at what he was thinking. She was
his last and truest love and only now can I excuse his helpless preoccupations
and my mother's own indulgences that slowly destroyed her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

discomfort. I remember feeling like the knot on a tug-o-war rope stretching
over a chasm between heaven and earth and life and death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

standing like a weary soldier at the back of the chapel. And as I rose again

to touch her, the hand pulled away. A cigarette smoldered between her fingers
and slid towards her unseen lips for another kiss never meant for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

find contentment even though my mother years ago had withdrawn so often to the
porch, transfixed by something he wasn't a part of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wanted her to love me unfailingly, but as she walked below, giving life to the
garden, I saw her disdain when she saw me on the parapet above her. This was
the first time I had ever attracted her attention, the first time she had ever
acknowledged me. But she couldn't see my sincerity or my devotion. She saw
something ugly inside of me surface and molt into something crude and
rapacious. My very presence threatened her with the same sincerity and devotion
that created her, and I could do nothing but look away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stood on the balcony the following day and watched the winter birds jump
between gargoyles on the parapet. Their dark forms looked like black spheres
balled up into tiny fists of feathers. Their songs were low and short, but
mostly they kept quiet and flew in small, tight patterns from tree to shrub to
fence without making the smallest sound. The garden and adjacent meadow
provided sparse cover and made no effort to hide them within its own tawny
grasses. Instead, the dark birds took shelter near the ground in leafless brush
resembling nests of crumpled wire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

winter birds held the earth's spirit. They lived and moved where nothing else
would. I stood inside the doorway and watched them twitch and peck at seeds and
pieces of cracker that I had dropped for them earlier. They stayed for only a
moment. Their eyes moved about searching for predators that I could not imagine
against the still landscape. Aside from a neighbor's cat creeping around a
light pole or a hedge of blueblossom, the dark birds gave the earth its only
motion. They told of the earth's former personality; they told of its
compassion, warmth and color.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

birds flew off and gathered in the nearby meadow. And when they were still, I
could not distinguish them from the shadowy pieces of turf turned up by the
neighbor's brood mare. The wind was calm and quiet. I could hear nothing, not
even the clock from inside the doorway, not even a random scraping of branches
from the ash and cypress against the building. Nothing in the garden or in the
meadow moved. The sheer absence of sound and motion gave the moment an eerie
tension. The dark birds and the pale landscape created a loneliness that wasn't
entirely unpleasant. It made me want to sleep, to envision myself stuffed
within a warm bed piled with downy quilts and pillows. Time never moved more
slowly. Fatigue lingered in the coldness and I fell asleep uncovered in an
overstuffed lounge chair in the middle of the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

before sundown I swept off the balcony and brought in a chair that someone
dragged out after lunch. The afternoons are brisk but last a few minutes more
each day. Spring is coming and I can feel it gaining momentum every evening
when the library closes. It starts with just one chair left on the patio and
eventually precedes another and maybe one or two more. Last year I set up a
small table against the parapet and stocked it with chips and queso. A couple
of school girls had brought up a tray of St. Patrick's Day cookies, and I set
them out with a stack of paper cups and a liter of ginger ale and orange soda.
The gargoyle nearest the door served as a coat rack and the balcony was at last
ready for the new season. When the tourists returned in June, the friendly
gargoyle became their backdrop and was photographed with a dozen or so
strangers before the autumn came and its use was once again restricted to
holding coats, hats and umbrellas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
