<p style="padding-top:9px;">I'll admit, sometimes it feels like I'm on a carnival ride that just won't stop. And I wonder how it got this
	way. I've re-traced my steps from the first one to this one and have realized that my life to this point has been nothing more
	than an artifact of experiences both planned and unplanned. I have often felt the need to
	improvise, which in many ways has been easier than actually planning something. But regardless of how
	I got here, by
	sticking to a plan or going with the flow, who I am today has got me thinking about by who I was yesterday.
	And so in the middle of the night, I
	stumble into the kitchen and knock down a photo of grandma while fumbling for the light
	switch.
	I improvise as though I'm in a strange new place. And in the darkness I reach out for gram's picture guided only by intuition. Our histories are like footprints on a map--a record
	of our past and a guide for those who proceed us. In spite of my best efforts and preparations, most of my
	life
	is an improvisation. So in light of this new realization, I will try to lay out a short bio hoping to bridge the gap between <em>planned</em> events and <em>what the hell just happened</em> events.
</p>

<p> Well, let's see. I gasped my first breath the Sunday evening of January 20, 19-something. Don't ask me my
    age unless you're prepared to believe a lie. I was adopted as a baby, am the middle child of 3, grew up in
    Texas and Indiana, Captain of the swim team (okay, not really, but I was <span class="em">on</span> the swim
    team), rode motorcycles through corn fields, paddled canoes over waterfalls, dreamed of being a poet, an
    expatriate
    living in a far and distant land. I went to college in Utah and Texas and have a BA in Theatre and another
    one in English (composition &amp; rhetoric). I lived in New York City for a while and attended the National
    Shakespeare Conservatory but dropped out after spending all of my student-aid money on 2-months rent, a
    plate of eggs benedict and a basketball. I know, crazy, right? Why did I buy a <span
            class="em">basketball</span>? </p>

<p>I worked as a technical editor for a publishing company in NYC. Recently married, we lived in a tiny "artsy"
    (meaning mouse and roach infested) studio in Gramercy Park. A couple of years later, our beautiful daughter
    was born and we moved to Texas where I went to work for its democratic governor. And suddenly I discovered
    that I was a closet socialist and then summarily &quot;fired&quot; when Bush came to town. I spent my early
    career looking for a career. Spent my mid-career trying to resuscitate my first career and soon thereafter
    settled into my current career that felt like coming to after falling down the balcony stairs. I love what I
    do, sort of, and do it sort of well. Initially, however, I wanted to write novels on a beach in Northern
    Africa or make cheese out of a wagon while traveling with gypsies, but I was pressed into a real job due to
    the above mentioned child and a delinquent student loan.</p>

<p>Anyway, I married a great girl before I was ready, before I purged myself of those delusions we endured in
    the early to mid-90's. We had a great kid amidst the fallout of denial, anger, and acceptance that these
    delusions endowed us with. So it was imminent that divorce would inevitably follow, that this train I was
    riding was approaching a dark tunnel to oblivion--a wormhole into the cold isolation of insensible space. It
    was at that moment I was hit with a <span class="em">life brick</span>, as I call it, and knocked from the
    mystery train to
    travel a parallel path while my injuries healed themselves over time and distance, a realization that only
    then I could perceive more truthfully.</p>

                           src="us1.jpg" width="216" height="151"/>I've
    always believed that life is a journey as depicted by the tiny rune tattooed on my hand. Some go through
    life proclaiming no regrets. Whatever. In my view, life is about regret. Without it, where's the growth? How
    is there self-realization in a context that transcends the here and now, that leads to a greater
    understanding of the human condition and our place within it? Today I aim to journey on without the pathos
    of a martyr looking over his shoulder at an image blurred by age and remorse. I try to guide my life by that
    tiny voice within me struggling each day to sever myself from ego and impetuism...(not sure if that's a
    word, but...). I hope to obtain someday the wise dignity of an artist or a scholar; always pressing forward
    like <span class="em">everyman</span>--going to work, paying the bills, feeding the family, reasoning his
    way through days
    that go on and on like rain dripping down a mountain.</p>

<p>But, gratefully, I don't spend my days gasping for breath like I did 40-something years ago. I own up to a
    few regrets like ordering 4 star Duck Pou at Racha down the hill, but the grass is green and the air is
    fresh and crisp. </p>
