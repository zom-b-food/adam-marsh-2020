with the window shut, I could feel the wind rushing into the upstairs room.
Like air blowing through a straw, it whistled. I could have stayed there
forever, plugging the seam with my thumb, feeling nature's power and changing at
whim the draft's pitch and tone by sliding my hand up and down the window's
cracked pane. From inside, I was stronger than I'd ever been, and for the
moment, nature was at my mercy. Withstanding her was never more simple. By
merely raising a hand I could stop her, and so I stood there feeling her
against the thin window, thrusting herself into my opened palm as though she
were writing a message in my hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>For
a moment, I thought of wedging a piece of cardboard between the pane and the
shutter, but for some reason, I just stood there waving my hand in front of the
passing air. Nature had come for me and stopping her, I thought, would have
been cruel, for she had only wanted to be near me and if I chose to hurt her,
all I had to do was simply walk away. I imagined her trying to knock, trying to
unlatch the window and come to me. So I stood there, hand extended, as she
touched me. And once she had, all I wanted to do was please her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>During
the night, it rained, just barely. A cranberry haze soaked up the dawn's light
and energy and crept through the freckled milkvetch and the season's first
wintergreens only now beginning to stretch their cottony whiskers sideward. Now
and then, when the weather's nice, I'll leave the front door open, as I had
last night. The chinkapin's dying branches break up the wind coming onto the
porch. Thick, woodsy air lingers there like a cautious neighbor before passing
through the screen door and into the living room. Even inside the house, fresh
coffee can be detected stirring and blending with air from the porch, the
meadow and all around Dakota Creek.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Waking
to the country's freshness each morning is more invigorating than a shower and
more inviting than a church usher. Mangan's Sister understands this feeling.
She enjoyed the morning, relaxing on the piano, carelessly waving her tail past
some sheet music and a few pieces of neglected mail. A circular from a local
market blew from a newspaper beside her and floated in the air, flipping once
and then sliding along the floor like a heron landing on a still pond. Such was
the condition of my home early this morning. But soon, a visitor would come,
and the house, more or less, was too comfortably disheveled for guests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Yesterday,
before I closed the library, Mr. Campion left me some photographs of his son's
recent wedding. He was planning to come by this afternoon to pick them up and
of course, to visit. Mr. Campion seemed surprised by the fact that his boy,
Robert Jr., was able to persuade a girl to marry him. All of the Campions, in
fact, seemed astounded by the event and with the luck that brought young Robert
and Elizabeth (or "Lizbeth" as old Robert had corrected me earlier) together,
notwithstanding his obvious homeliness, though amply disguised by a cordial
demeanor and a little creative grooming. I had never seen his bride in person.
But in every photo she was lovely; she looked perfectly healthy and downright
blissful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
Campions on the other hand looked rather ghastly, almost certifiably ugly, in
my opinion. I had always pitied the ugly, until I saw in those photographs
love's less obvious conclusions. I thought of little else this morning when I
woke and looked into the bathroom mirror. Robert Jr., by most accounts, had won
a victory for ugly people everywhere, but a victory perhaps not all that
uncommon and of course not all that undeserved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Shortly
after lunch I watched from the upstairs window the Campions' long, silver van
pull into my driveway. It was a noisy machine dented and scratched on every
side. Before it completely stopped I watched its side-panel door begin sliding
open. Pairs of small hands pushed hard against it like a family of tiny aliens
struggling to escape from their partially demolished space pod. By the time I
reached the door the smallest two aliens had emerged waving sticks at each
other and running around the yard and between the groomed hedgerow of holly and
bright yellow pansies. I watched from behind the screen door as three more
aliens left the wreck, yelling at the youngest two now balancing on the stones
that encircled the once groomed hedgerow of holly and bright yellow pansies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Mr.
Campion smiled and waved when I walked onto the porch to welcome them. He moved
slowly as if he slept all night on the floor and offered his hand still a
respectable distance from the porch. Of course I reached for it offering an
expected welcome and a little help managing the few steps up to my house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
three of them stood in the doorway until I returned from the kitchen with the
photos. Only when I knelt before the coffee table and laid the pictures across
it did they finally approach me. Mr. Campion fussed with his glasses while his
youngest walked slowly, but directly to Mangan's Sister still lying on the
piano. She placed her on her lap and they sat together on the narrow bench,
grooming each other with compliments and uninhibited affection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>We
were soon disrupted by screams coming from the front yard. Apparently one of
the two aliens had smacked the other with his stick. "I told you not to hold it
like that," one yelled at the other. No one in the room, except for Sister and
I, seemed to even notice the screams, or maybe the others were only attuned to
the necessary ones. Mr. Campion just waved his arm and kept babbling about the
wedding. So I too went back to the photographs, handling carefully each one by
the edges, showing more respect to Mr. Campion by doing so. He shared a story
about every picture. And every picture and every story featured the lovely
Lizbeth. She stood out in every picture. But to stand out among the Campions, I
confess, all one has to do is stand...I doubt if <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lizbeth's</i> family even brought a camera. It was that bad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

oldest stayed close to her father, trying to disassociate from her sister and
her two younger brothers outside. Eventually she relaxed and began to look
around, examining the features of the room and associating with its antiquity,
so romantic and yet so muted and confused. She studied at first a few framed
photographs resting on a cambric throw on top of the piano. And from there she
moved toward the stairway and gazed up for a time at the studio door. I was
sure it was closed, but I wondered for a moment if she had seen the artist whom
I had only imagined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>She
wanted to see more. And as she did, I saw more of her. She wasn't bored as her
father may have feared anticipating her displeasure to running errands on an
otherwise promising afternoon. But a visit to my home, I assumed, was like a
field trip to a museum or a monastery--someplace fabled and creepy and curious.
Mr. Campion went on about the wedding and I listened politely while his oldest
browsed the bookshelves against the wall, dragging a finger along the titles
without reading a single word but feeling instead their dusty spines, moving
from one object to another, discovering in the process something appreciable
and attractive about herself. Like the expansion joints on a freeway, her
fingers likewise bumped along each book and seam, each inch and half-inch, each
ridge and groove of the shelf top. Her countenance showed her infatuation and I
began to see her as another artifact, a figure of romance and mystery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>There
were other items in the room that drew her attention as well. And, in turn, she
touched them all: the ivory sphere, the wooden totem, the feather mask, the paper
teacup. She was so dutiful examining the living room and absorbing the hidden
properties of my personality, tastes and history. Her intrigue was contagious
and reminded me of my visit to the ossuary. Almost overwhelmingly, I wanted to
take her there. I wanted to leave her father and my all too familiar
surroundings and escape. And I realized to my own delight and horror how I
wanted to explore her. I wanted the bee to settle deep into the young begonia
and become its complete and unfamiliar satisfaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Once
she satisfied her curiosity, she settled onto the vinyl rocker in front of the
window. The wind had picked up. I could hear the chinkapin on the porch scratch
against the roof as sporadic gusts from the north blew into the valley. The sun
was making its way to the western end of the house, stretching the shadows in
the front yard and bending the lean, pale ones against the living room wall.
The girl in the rocker turned her cheek into the warm vinyl, and within
minutes, she too faded away, sleeping ever so lightly that a mere sigh could
disturb her. Looking at her was like looking through a window at an image that
can never change. She would always be plain and unattractive. But perhaps
someone will see the light around her, perhaps that will change, perhaps that
will be enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>At
last the ordeal was over. Mr. Campion rose quickly pretending to be late for
another engagement. The youngest, with some reluctance, squeezed Sister and
kissed her nose before setting her back on the piano. And the girl in the
armchair raised her head and stood more eagerly than I expected, not bothering
to stretch or to pull back her hair that had fallen across her face like a
veil. She took her father's arm as I pushed open the screen door and said
good-bye. The boys in the yard dropped their sticks by the driveway, climbed
into the van and closed the sliding door more easily than they had opened it.
Leaving seemed for them a simpler task than arriving. But I was glad to be
alone again and accepted that jarring silence more willingly than I had in the
past.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
wind at the upstairs window whistled and I concluded that the door had swung
open. Branches above the porch tapped against the house, and briefly, I thought
the two boys were standing in the wind knocking, batting at the chinkapin with
their sticks, trying to get in before the old tree wrapped them in its feeble
trunk and swallowed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Sister
stretched each leg independently, shook her face like a wet dog, then leaped
onto the floor and disappeared into the kitchen. I stood at the front window
until the Campions disappeared around a corner and then fell into the armchair
still warm and soft and smelling like a young girl's perfume. The old chair had
acquired another story and I another memory. The newlyweds, on the other hand,
were just beginning a story, their story together that is. Getting married, I
imagine, is like crafting a novel&#8212;merging two stories into one in the middle of
a single tale. I was happy for the young Campions and replayed the stories in
my mind of their wedding and engagement. Something was in the air the night
they met, and some mysterious power took an ordinary night and made it
something special.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>They
say there's someone for everyone. Young Robert, in that light, isn't any
luckier than the next guy. But it is youth, I suspect, more than anything that
assures even the plainest of companionship and love. In the middle of life,
those without beauty or charm, have pets. And every morning that I wake to
Sister purring in my ear, I am reminded of a fairy tale where the faithful,
young beauty is revived from death by love's patient kiss. Tomorrow, like every
morning, I'll wake after dawn, rub Sister's neck, and walk to the bathroom
thinking about the Campions and gauging their plainness against my own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Novel style='line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Robert
Jr. had youth and perhaps a beauty not obscured by a book or a peculiar charm
unnoticed while walking along the creek or daydreaming at the upstairs window.
Apparently, he possessed a different kind of beauty, the kind that girls do not
smile at, but the kind that girls marry. My own superficiality was alarming. It
surprised me no less, I'm sure, than luck surprised the Campions. So for the
rest of the day I brooded about my own solitude which never before seemed to
bother me, that is until I saw those pictures, until I saw that aging
reflection in the bathroom mirror. What an awakening, I thought. What a
surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
