a patico of statues, benches and flower beds that for some reason fails to

except for a sliding-glass door on the stone balcony. The balcony meets a
sloping walkway that leads to the patico downstairs. The second floor is
divided among the library, classrooms, a few school offices and a storage room

the house is simple, almost a perfect square if not for a couple of bay windows
on the south and west walls. The north and east walls are cool most of the

a new year it seems, or maybe a wedding&#8212;a consummation by the look of things.

Sister weathered the storm, purchased on the piano bench. The sound of my
playing, comparable to thunder, must transfix her, purring as usual, paws and
chin resting upon my lap. Unfortunately, I practice only as often as it rains
here. The piano, more than anything, simply serves as a reminder of music.
Where the mission choir is an ensemble of cathedral acoustics, gothic
accompaniment and the interplay of audience and angels; my piano, on the other
hand, is the solo. It is only me. It is more sound than music, more clich� than
opus, more heart than voice. But Mangan's Sister lays still and listens; and
maybe in the studio upstairs, my music is heard as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the rain dilutes the valley's colors, it enriches the air with earthy aromas as
hearty as smoke. After the rain, the fertile air draws all life into the open,
noses swelling upward, windward, townsfolk pondering the familiarity in the air
that only comes after rain. Green cologne of the river, woods and sea and
everything sweet that perished in the storm attacks the senses like a crusade
of meadows. Topsoil smells up the air with that rich, gritty decay of earth.
The air brings a spring-cleaned energy comparable to that of April's last layer
of snow sinking into the piney soil, cleaning the earth's pores before
trickling into pools and streams across the valley.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is generally hot and dry here. So dry that in my bare feet I cannot crush the
dirtclods in the flower bed around my mailbox. But there's nothing more
therapeutic for the feet than standing in hot, dry clumpy dirt. On occasion,
I've read every scrap of mail while standing in the dirt at the roadside,
enjoying that special kind of pain. Sometimes it is too hot; but other times it
is perfect&#8212;just hot enough to hurt, just a little, just enough. The climax of
coughing too harshly or stretching too completely or scratching an itch too

house. I went up on a day I stayed home with the flu. Restlessness kept me from
sleeping on the couch or reading in the back yard. The doldrums, depression's
mildest genre, drew me to the old art room all but drenched in shade save for a
stream of sunlight trailing from the window. The sunbeam hit the opposite wall
illuminating particles of dust, the detritus of space sparkling like snow in
the glow of a streetlight. The room itself resembled a chiaroscuro painting of
nothing but itself; it was an empty display case presenting nothing but its own
light. But the room was mesmerizing in spite of itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sister had a litter of kittens in the upstairs studio last winter. I found her
and her cubs between a wall and a folded up card table. There's a particular
curiosity that arises in me whenever significant change presents itself, and I
knew that change was coming, for Mangan's Sister anyway. Before she found a
suitable spot for bearing her cubs, she roamed throughout the house as though
she had misplaced her wallet or keys. Maybe she was sensitive to secrets about
the house where she was soon to become a mother. Maybe she was researching her
own roots before setting out branches, before growing leaves, before dropping
fruit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

winced and mewed when I pulled away the card table and let in the sunlight. She

spell has weakened and that you have not been overtaken indefinitely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I answered their distress calls from the second or third steps when their

cubs were discovering other rooms downstairs and the hedge rows and flower beds
immediately around the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

recovered quickly from that initial shock of producing something substantive,
something out of the everyday, and resumed her usual habits: napping and vying
for my attention against her children or a note pad, a book or a bowl of ice
cream. She was surprisingly jealous of her children's attention. She wanted me
to do nothing but pet her and showed no resistance at all to my dolling out her
kittens to the neighborhood children. I did it slowly, one kitten every odd
day, letting Sister gradually adapt to being single, to being without
responsibility, to shedding that motherness instinct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would see in her happiness, popularity, and direction my own isolation,
failure, and aimlessness. I'd be tortured by my love for her and the selfish
understanding that love, passion, recognition, and happiness skips a

As fundamental as air, so too is play for children and Sister's kittens,

children have the tooth as well. Needless to say, finding homes for Mangan's

is reflected or trapped that the closer branches burn up and in the spring they
fail to rebud. The tree is so large that from the mailbox at the end of the drive,
it's hard to tell that a second floor room is even there. One day I'll need to
prune it. But for some odd reason, part of me wants it to go ahead and die. The
struggle for the chinkapin to stay alive bears punishing consequences for us
higher life forms caught up in the same struggle. Every time I see its burned
up branches over the porch, I am reminded of a particular failure of my
childhood. And each time I would remember, guilt would drive me further away
from responsibility and further into denial and justification. So I've never
lifted a finger to save it. Letting go of the tree however would be easy, as
easy as aiding a kitten up a couple of stairs. I've often wondered if the
