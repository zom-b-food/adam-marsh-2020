I'll discover a new fragrance coming through the window or from the pile of old books on the nightstand or from the bed sheets recently washed by a quiet stranger still adjusting to her own independence. And then I'll question my own freedom and discover that my dreams have been indentured by change and I've embraced a new choice as though it were a long aspired goal finally reached. By nightfall I will remember what I've lost and realize that my independence was at some point compromised by a lifetime of worry, doubt and ignorance. Experience is my last reward; and time will make from it another memory that I will tuck away inside me until the dream is over and I awake to another day tapping at my window." </span>

        the bay breezes through my room,<br/>
        and a pen rolls across the bureau <br/>
        so, so slowly<br/>
        while a note glides lightly, gently <br/>
        to the foot of my bed. <br/>
        green springs trickle through the bamboo<br/>
        knocking against the porch<br/>
        as though it were wrapped in a pillow.
        <br/><br/>
        the bright night illuminates;<br/>
        and just beyond the tide's reaching touch <br/>
        the dunes bow softly into the hillside.<br/>
        jasmine and willow sway above the pond <br/>
        where a turtle&#8212; <br/>
        high priest of this garden,<br/>
        rests like me on a ripple<br/>
        of circumspection: <br/>
        a meditation, a prayer <br/>
        a thought not born into speech.
        <br/><br/>
        a toad bellows low in the reed beds, <br/>
        fireflies linger in the air; <br/>
        and a dandelion ascends <br/>
        as some do in September <br/>
        rising into the dark light. <br/>
        the fat yellow moon pulls his eyelids down, <br/>
        the warm silver ghost cups me in her hands; <br/>
    bliss dripping like dew from her fingers<br/>
        and I succumb to her relentless serenity&#8212; <br/>
          the unsparing comfort of sedation.
        <br/><br/>
        the cadence of the clock, <br/>
        like footsteps on the bare floor <br/>
        taps out a beat&#8212; <br/>
        the pulse of nature, of some divinity <br/>
        nesting somewhere near; <br/>
        a mass for the living <br/>
        blessed in its subjectivity, <br/>
        mercy and compassion.
		<br/>
       <br/>
       a spanish guitar floats its voices here  <br/>

from a terrace down the hill,    <br/>

as if it were a memory    <br/>

unplugged from the dissonance of age  <br/>

coming humbly, joyfully home&#8212;  <br/>

all of life's perfections  <br/>

distilled to its finest hour   <br/>

is now.


  <br/><br/>
the wind loosens the drapes   <br/>
unfolding like wings in the doorway  <br/>
as the humble turtle hums  <br/>
and a leaf drifts by  <br/>
so, so slowly...
