so many others, I'm a genius procrastinator. No excuse is too lame or feable to
delay a project or postpone a chore as common as making my bed&#8212;an absurd thing
to do anyway, don't you have to unmake it at the end of the day? In any event,
it is usually just the beginning of a project that troubles me. Once an
activity is up and running, I'm just as diligent and devoted as the next guy.
But starting something from scratch frightens me. Perhaps it is just the fear
of screwing up a perfectly good idea that keeps me from attempting it in the
first place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>Doing something for the
first time, or just starting a chore over tyring this time to do it right, is
an intimidating attitude, but mine nonetheless. But of course, repeating a
failed task isn't as fearful as I sometimes make it out to be. Any routine, no
matter how unpleasant, can be comforting if I can forsee its completion and can
finally move on to something else. I use such excuses each morning like a
crutch to pull myself out of bed and make my way to the mission library before
the schoolbell rings at 8am. The walk along the creek is the most reassuring
part of the day along with the familiar warmth of my library study where
personal effects lay around in a cozy confusion. Never finding a pencil when I
most desparately need one is an acceptable inconvenience. By the look of the
room, you would think it was winter. Coats, scarves and sweaters balance on the
arm of a chair and the corner cabinet. Pale, gauze-like sheers hang in front of
the outside window like pantlegs a size too long, dragging uncuffed on the
floor. In the afternoon, I will part them to sterilize the room with light. But
I am not ready now. The morning mustn't be rushed. In <st1:country-region

morning is slow, cool, quiet. On Monday as the sun begins to pull itself up,
I'll sometimes sit out on the back stoop before dressing for work. I'll listen
to someone rolling a bicycle out to the curb. I'll listen to someone else
closing a door and school children playing around the bus stop. And I'll wait
there on the stoop until I hear a few voices from the resident birds, the
neighborhood's original neighbors, before washing out my coffee cup and
preparing for the day. The backyard, mostly in shadow, is cold. But the shade
will eventually recede and it will be warm again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

worry and duty do not bully the day's most virtuous hours. Coffee must brew&#8212;not
for drinking, but for smelling; nothing must be allowed to hurry thought and
contemplation. The room must not be tidied but left alone to face the morning
honestly. The morning must be allowed to inspire. The morning must invite one
to smile, to exhale, to nap if so inclined&#8212;or reclined. The morning, if we let
it, will in real time share with us its wisdom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I must admit that often I dawdle away the morning's wisdom scratching a toenail
or pulling protruding feathers from a pillow. I prepare to receive the
morning's inspiration and when it comes I trade it for a few magic beans. I
spend time like loose change. But the good side to dawdling is that dawdlers
can become adept at explaining things, at justifying causes and rationalizing
their effects. In many ways I consider my routine as a mere decimal
point&#8212;something more absolute than it ought to be, something too little to have
all that authority and control. So I explained to myself that by the time the
average working man parks his car, drinks a cup of french roast, hangs up
neatly his topcoat, ergonomically repositions his desk toys, reads the
headlines, considers his need for a haircut and sharper jawline, I have plucked
an offensive hair from my ear, shaved an old juice stain out of the carpet and
followed a floating leaf along the creekside. Settling down to work I contend
takes an awful lot of settling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <st1:place w:st="on">Valencia</st1:place>

school and now comes to the library almost daily. He'll sit at a table for
hours as though he were waiting for a flood of students with a flood of queries
on the motherhood of fresh-water clams. I've often caught him staring out the
window onto the balcony. Before coming regularly to the library, I've been told
he'd spend hours at the teacher's lounge in the school downstairs, working on
the same book. I've been told he spent most of the day staring out the window
onto the street. I suppose for hours he'd sit there waiting for something to
happen, something inspiring to write. I see a great deal of myself in Mr.
Soals. I wonder when I retire from the library if I'll hang out in the
teacher's lounge staring out the window, watching bicyclists cruising down the
sidewalk or gauging the frequency at which the stoplight changes colors on the
corner. I wonder if I'll have a book of my own to write.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the weather, Mr. Soals arrives wearing the same tweed sportscoat and tapping
upon the ground an old wooden umbrella that he raises in greeting upon entering
the room. He brings with him a black plastic lunchpale as though he were on his
way to work at the quarry. He carries under the same arm a rolled-up book of
crosswords and a spiral notebook. For hours he'll sit at the table, staring out
the window while spinning a ball-point pen around his thumb and catching it in
writing form between his thumb and finger. I've practiced this little stunt for
years and still cannot do it. And as long as I've been practicing, I have yet
to see a page of Mr. Soals' manuscript. Between the crosswords and gazing out
the window, the old man passes the time scraping a cuticle or tugging at a
hangnail. Now and then he'll bite a finger and then wipe it against a hip while
popping a knuckle and readjusting his chair. Sometimes a couple or a threesome
will sit nearby talking amongst themselves. Mr. Soals will appear not to
notice. He'll remain attentive to his fidgeting, never bothered by the
distractions of others. Yet I have noticed him eyeing a few boys who had
wandered into the library to use the drinking fountain and then the bathroom.
Each boy toted a skateboard and looked as though he had just finished repaving
the highway. Mr. Soals may have recognized them from school and was curious as
to what young boys did in their free time. Perhaps he was asking in his own way
for suggestions on what he could do tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pondering and producing. In my case, I dawdle about as often and about as much

here at the library. We think a lot too, we consider a lot of nonsense I

It has become my prot�g�, my better self, my footprint. I have read nearly
every volume and I read attentively excerpts and reviews of everything I
purchase. My buying criteria is as stiffly defined as is my reading criteria.
Donated materials that fail to meet this criteria are packed up and put in the

houses narratives, personal essay collections, creative nonfiction, criticism
and several anthologies of American and English poetry and literature. Books on
writing, painting and other creative trades are on the west wall. In the center

an almanac or searching for an island on the globe or copying a report from the
encyclopedia. Before long, mom or dad is snoozing quite comfortably in the
chair, while child is dawdling in front of the bulletin board. If Mr. Soals
came on Saturday, I'm sure he'd pay no attention at all. Or maybe he'd surprise
me and lend the child a hand; maybe he'd show her around the place, point out
useful tools on the research counter and the newspaper rack. Or maybe Mr. Soals
would be snoozing in the chair, holding in his lap a manuscript or an empty

There is no card catalogue, just a few typewritten signs and the friendly

Unfortunately, there isn't a place here for children. Mangan's Sister sometimes

for someone else, bringing their kids in their unobstructed immediacy that upon
leaving, only a jarring silence remains. It's like someone coming to visit the
sick: they stay long enough to say that they came. The children bring a
compelling rush when they come. They bring their little playgrounds with them
for me and Sister to play in. I used to think that as an adult, I would
exchange the vulnerability of childhood for the self reliance of adulthood. But
of course nothing is evenly exchanged in maturity, and a vulnerable few cannot
avoid that peculiar madness that comes with age, the madness that removes us
from what is real and familiar and places us upon a stage. Our part, unprepared

its patron saint. People don't always come to read, write or study; they don't
even wander through the room as I expect them to do. They come to escape or
hide or simply rest. They think, or dawdle, while staring out the glass door or
reviewing the rows and columns of books. Sometimes they stand on the balcony
gazing at the gardens below. Maybe they drag out a chair and sit in the shade
of the Russian Olive that has been here since the beginning. Maybe they sit in
the sunlight, close their eyes and nap, or rest while discovering, barefooted,
the sandy texture of the balcony's foundation. I do not know why they come. But
the library does. The library becomes the everything to everyman. It serves as
a place to read, a place to not read; a place to be alone, a place to not be
alone. Sometimes the library is a place where people just end up. They may wait
by the maps or the novels for a cab, a friend or an attractive face to approach
or pass by. Sometimes the library catches them following the stone walkway from
the patico below. It may be the X on a treasure map or just the random spot
where one ends up to think random thoughts, to be random himself, to be a
random color on a painting or a random digit in a math book or a random key on

morning. Anciently, they were created to ward off evil spirits, to frighten
them, to mirror evil's ugliness. Every morning when I wake and drag my tail
into the bathroom, the mirror there reflects my own dreaded ugliness. Cosmetics
do what they can but it's still there watching itself, waiting for its
reflection to lie, or to change its mind. Thank God for electricity. I can just

alive. The walls make fantastic plant ledges. And the stone is cool and
comfortable to lean on after a spring shower. Between the four plant boxes, I
sprinkled some seeds for the resident squirrels and birds. I'm not a bird
person, but I can pick out the pair of cardinals from among the other
generic-looking species living in the area. The cardinals live within a hedge
of vetch and stitchwort; their blue spotted eggs nested where hands can't
easily reach. The gargoyles don't scare the cardinals or the squirrels away,
although something must be done to keep the squirrels from eating all of the
bird seed. Now and then I throw some fennel seeds and cracker crumbs for the
smaller birds. Tomorrow I'll put out some corn for the squirrels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

begonias aren't really the prey. Once or twice during the summer a bee will fly
into the library. It eventually finds its way back through the door but until

bee friends around the honey comb at night. Bees don't commonly bother me
outdoors, but when they invade my indoor places they seem to fly more
furiously, buzz more meanly. They blame me for raising walls and holding them
under a roof. Their freedom is stolen and outside of their own environment they

plastids, dermal and vascular tissues&#8212;a cytoplasmic pudding. They will sink
into their potted soil, becoming organic slag, dissipating into hydrogen and
carbon dioxide, coalescing into nascent pieces of dirt: iron, potassium, phosphorus,
nitrates and oxides that I sweep every weekend from the porch and sidewalk.
Their environment is what makes them what they are. And for the begonia, the
bee is an integral part of that environment. The begonia may look, feel, smell
like a begonia. It may exhibit all the remedial signs or prerequisites of a
begonia, but it is nothing more than a prototype, a representation of the real
thing. It cannot come to life until a nearby bee flies into its garden, hovers
over its blossoms, stretches into its stamen, and drinks. One testifies of the
other; their environments let them live and their living explains what they

the writer unwind. Eventually I'll put the toy aside and get back to work until
another thought passes or another paragraph ends and what remains of the boy
within me emerges again to play.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

see the hills from the balcony when the clouds break apart at the treeline and
sulk around the valley as the day ends. Come outside and sit on the parapet
beside the begonias now putting themselves away. Dusk on the balcony is less
devout than morning on the stoop. But like the dawn, the early hours of the
night cannot be rushed, cannot be allowed to come and go without talking back,
without showing its frostiness. The sunset has an attitude unlike the sunrise.
The sunset is more flamboyant, has more panache. The six o'clock hour flushes
the town of old, worn-out business and buckles like a wave across the valley. I
often wait for the wave to hit and roll past me while sitting on the parapet,
hugging my knees. The night comes swaggering, comes smiling, not yawning like the
morning. The night has that rolling in the hay with the leading lady kind of
feeling. Anticipation ends, the day's little climax releases you, the purging
leaves you hungry. Nothing sleeps or lies still&#8212;willingness to move precludes
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

while leaning against a gargoyle on the balcony, I will begin to notice the
first colors of October blooming upon the hilltops, creeping downward draping
the valley in the red, orange and copper commitments of the coming winter.
Nature will prepare herself for the change and congratulate herself for
completing another cycle, for coming home, returning to the nest. The bee and
the begonia are together for just a season producing a long-term memory of
their strangely embodied marriage. The morning and the night will never be
together outside of that mathematical second: the decimal point. But tonight
the gargoyles will come alive, and I'll wonder before going to sleep if they
will feel that jarring silence when the dusk goes dark and the leading lady
leaves for another roll on another wave beyond the valley.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
