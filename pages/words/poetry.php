  <h2>The Quantum Cycle of Life</h2>
  I am a bubble
  <br/>
  I am
  <em>in</em>
  a bubble--
  <br/>
  a particle
  <br/>
  a consciousness (aquiring qualia)<br/>
  rising to the top<br/>
  of the sea of humanity;
  <br/>
  ---<br/>
  A lifetime of ages pass
  <br/>
  atmosphere at last<br/>
  and I am released into the light<br/>
  ---<br/>
  I am a wave
  <br/>
  I am
  <em>in</em>
  the wave--<br/>
  a consciousness (qualia aquired)
  <br/>
  a soul.<br/>
  I am everywhere<br/>
  at peace with the gods and angels.

  <h2>Veils</h2>
  I wake up
  <br/>
  in the dark house
  <br/>
  and without a bump
  <br/>
  I find the chair by the window.
  <br/>
  Warm rain on the glass
  <br/>
  distant train whistle
  <br/>
  seedcorn due--
  <br/>
  fields of it.
  <br/>
  &nbsp;<br/>
  Nature not asleep;
  <br/>
  a tiny spider dashes from beneath the sink<br/>
  as if he were pulled by a string
  <br/>
  in the natural light from which I see no source
  <br/>
  and I look away to the farm.
  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
  My oak chair creaks
  <br/>
  and my feet on the bare tile
  <br/>
  can feel the cool crumbs of dust
  <br/>
  so undisturbed
  <br/>
  this quiet night.
  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
  Unlit but warm
  <br/>
  cooler floor than bone<br/>
  old oak chair but earnest
  <br/>
  sleeping neighbors unaware of evening?s other shadow.
  <br/>
  And the warmer air of harvest
  <br/>
  begins to taste
  <br/>
  or sound like willow or silk
  <br/>
  on summer's rainy window.
  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>
  Ambience like old pajamas
  <br/>
  just light enough for sleeping;
  <br/>
  a breeze lifts the window veils
  <br/>
  and I look away to the farm.
  <br/>&nbsp;<br/>

  <br/>
  <h2>Vigil</h2>
  I remember the way I came
  <br/>
  walkingstick in hand
  <br/>
  booted loosely, lazely
  <br/>
  dewdamp grass touching my knees
  <br/>
  tasseltops shining
  <br/>
  smelling like jam.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>
  The whole valley was green
  <br/>
  preening birds preparing
  <br/>
  quick and subtle movements
  <br/>
  like wind through a pipe
  <br/>
  unseen whistle singing
  <br/>
  from baby thrush and wren.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>
  Cold river rocks
  <br/>
  vanishing steam from slower currents
  <br/>
  cloudy like tea or musk
  <br/>
  dicentra at my fingers
  <br/>
  sun behind and moist air
  <br/>
  like blackberry on my mouth.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>
  Vigil
  <br/>
  all of dawn remembering
  <br/>
  the way I came;
  <br/>
  I smell the path fresh every morning
  <br/>
  always remembering the way.

  <h2>After the Rain</h2>
  After the rain
  <br/>
  and under the yellow clouds
  <br/>
  I rose to the words
  <br/>
  of birdsong
  <br/>
  whistling between the leaves of the
  <br/>
  summer storm
  <br/>
  with daisies
  <br/>
  and aging blossoms of apples
  <br/>
  and buttercups
  <br/>
  &nbsp;<br/>
  I came to my home against
  <br/>
  the Hills
  <br/>
  where sun lit waterfalls filled
  <br/>
  the streams below;
  <br/>
  I heard still
  <br/>
  as a little boy in his father's hat
  <br/>
  and I climbed again
  <br/>
  the Hills
  <br/>
  and strode the neighbor's ground
  <br/>
  with a lonely pride that only
  <br/>
  children know.
  <br/>
  &nbsp;<br/>
  The summer sounds were brimming
  <br/>
  with Color:
  <br/>
  the purpling blooms were
  <br/>
  waving to the sea,
  <br/>
  and cartooned pastels
  <br/>
  robed the grasses
  <br/>
  bending in the tide of twilight,
  <br/>
  and I rose once more to
  <br/>
  the whispering words
  <br/>
  of Birdsong:
  <br/>
  a watery font
  <br/>
  with the summer scent
  <br/>
  of Home.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <h2>Communion</h2>
  Waiting for the late sounds
  <br/>
  to blow the leaves and
  <br/>
  porch bells slow
  <br/>
  I listen to the play of
  <br/>
  a far away hound
  <br/>
  and my feet crunching stones
  <br/>
  as I move;
  <br/>
  Yet then will I sit
  <br/>
  and feel the evening speak
  <br/>
  what the angels sing to God.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <h2>The Warm Brook</h2>
  Often the drip
  <br/>
  falls with the canon--
  <br/>
  Largo for the evening
  <br/>
  plays the melody away
  <br/>
  to the new-made night;
  <br/>
  and the sticks that bow
  <br/>
  from the hard trunk
  <br/>
  make me dance and drift
  <br/>
  on the warm brook,
  <br/>
  hoping you'll find me
  <br/>
  as your voice
  <br/>
  and your wish
  <br/>
  wakes the music in
  <br/>
  my soul
  <br/>
  to never sink alone,
  <br/>
  and I can dance
  <br/>
  to the canon's pace
  <br/>
  like falling sticks on
  <br/>
  a sterile stream.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>
  <hr class="curve"/>
  <br/>
  <h2>Low Tide</h2>
  The early morning waves
  <br/>
  lit by the moon a blue-grey hue
  <br/>
  glows the gentle sea
  <br/>
  as it rolls upon the sand
  <br/>
  I stand on.
  <br/>
  The air that sounds small
  <br/>
  upon the waving grass
  <br/>
  moves through my clothes,
  <br/>
  and on my face it stills
  <br/>
  till my breath returns again
  <br/>
  to the sea
  <br/>
  the blowing scent of wasted youth
  <br/>
  to dive at the foam in the waves
  <br/>
  that pound the quiet eve's crabs
  <br/>
  as they soak in the wash and loam,
  <br/>
  and I breathe in the night moon
  <br/>
  that lights me with its white;
  <br/>
  too soft to touch
  <br/>
  and too brief to kiss
  <br/>
  it sends the wind through my hair
  <br/>
  like the fingers of a patient girl
  <br/>
  and whisps to me the scent of salt and musk
  <br/>
  to savor the sand I still on
  <br/>
  as the waterwind
  <br/>
  and the sweet shoregrass
  <br/>
  walks my wish to the deep again.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <h2>Summer Bragging</h2>
  Popping beached jellyfish
  <br/>
  was the favorite summertime game
  <br/>
  longer sticks served best
  <br/>
  and quicker strides before and the sting
  <br/>
  were useful in bragging,
  <br/>
  too eager to work or worry
  <br/>
  we rode the waves
  <br/>
  till our bellies scraped the sand,
  <br/>
  and we raced the crabs
  <br/>
  back into the sea,
  <br/>
  saltwater always filled my mouth
  <br/>
  and I'd quit playing
  <br/>
  for a while
  <br/>
  until another jellyfish
  <br/>
  beached himself beside me.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>
  <hr class="curve"/>
  <br/>
  <h2>October Dews</h2>
  Its texture is compelling
  <br/>
  like gathered frost along
  <br/>
  the brush bottoms at dawn,
  <br/>
  it makes me cool
  <br/>
  and I breathe like a dragon
  <br/>
  coal-sweat spray,
  <br/>
  I wake with its alarm so early
  <br/>
  and touch the tent top
  <br/>
  that its beads may run
  <br/>
  down my finger
  <br/>
  wanting me to drink,
  <br/>
  everything looks new and growing
  <br/>
  in the haze and mist
  <br/>
  as I walk upon green needles
  <br/>
  and mossy smells
  <br/>
  tickle
  <br/>
  and compel with its feeling
  <br/>
  my hands and mouth to touch.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>
  <hr class="curve"/>
  <br/>
  <h2>First Light</h2>
  And then the pond will warm
  <br/>
  and morning's dust will float
  <br/>
  beneath the still cold mist
  <br/>
  and the smells like summer's dawn
  <br/>
  will raise its breath to the
  <br/>
  trees that shade you from
  <br/>
  the sky
  <br/>
  to sleep or run
  <br/>
  until you wake or rest
  <br/>
  and summer's first light
  <br/>
  is gone to older kin;
  <br/>
  and then the pool will boil
  <br/>
  and nature's love for nature
  <br/>
  will feed herself on her
  <br/>
  as the grasses dry in
  <br/>
  summer's dusk;
  <br/>
  and the now noon steam
  <br/>
  will make clouds high
  <br/>
  to fly with the birds and dust
  <br/>
  for a new place to wake
  <br/>
  and another you
  <br/>
  to shade.
  <br/>&nbsp;
  <br/>
  <hr class="curve"/>
  <br/>
  <h2>Manipulation</h2>
  Strong music plays little for me
  <br/>
  in my snoring chair
  <br/>
  thick will pillow
  <br/>
  heavy with boring stuff:
  <br/>
  sentimental fool
  <br/>
  writing of treason that stains the soul
  <br/>
  and warns the wet heart
  <br/>
  I stick with my pen;
  <br/>
  watery songs encourage the discontent
  <br/>
  to cheer at the sky
  <br/>
  like a freshly spoiled bride,
  <br/>
  "Long live the king!
  <br/>
  Kill the umpire!
  <br/>
  Hail Mary full of it!"
  <br/>
  Offend to be offended
  <br/>
  slap the child's hand
  <br/>
  and wash his dirty tongue;
  <br/>
  and I'll burn the bones in the bedroom
  <br/>
  while the nigger next door
  <br/>
  trims his desperate snuff
  <br/>
  and my memory sings from the alley,
  <br/>
  "Don't spill the blood of Gethsemane,
  <br/>
  the carpet's still too white."
