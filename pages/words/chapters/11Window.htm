very active choir whose conductor owns the local gas station and video store
with none of the latest hits ever seen there. But there is nature here and
antiquity. And that is enough for me and the shopkeepers downtown. But in the

have to ask, they treat her as an extension of myself, like a dependent or a

her name some uninformed restaurant workers might think of her as someone's
human sister. This is especially clear when I return to the library, open the

terribly insensitive to never give her a lunch break and to never call her by
her proper name. But some locals have been assuming this for years, I can't

It is the impetuous season, the rash season, the excuse for playing season: the

season when the chapel is crowded and I can sit in the back in case I have to
leave early. Perhaps I'll make it next week when the townsfolk will greet me as
though I've never missed a Sunday service, as if I were Quasimodo of the old

o'clock, I settled down by the bay window, sipping cranberry juice from its quart-sized
carton and gazing through the window at the street and at the mailbox I just
remembered hadn't been emptied all week. Wild daisies fanned out everywhere
along the road. The wind was calm. The glass was cool against my forearm but
the room was dry, airy and more comfortable than it had been in months. The
road was quiet; my neighbors must have made it to church, so when I saw two

were handsomely dressed. Not like your average tourist, these women were
dressed in casual business attire. Were it not for their ten�nis shoes and
cameras, I'd have thought a real estate agent was showing my house to a
prospective buyer. I got the impression that the taller, more attractive lady
was somehow familiar with the place, describing or explaining certain features
of the property&#8212;how everything has changed, how the town and the house used to
be before I moved in and the artist was still alive. The tall one then touched
the mailbox more fondly than one would usually expect. They stopped talking and
the small one crept around the side of the house, trying it seemed to sneak a
glimpse of the backyard and maybe the creek beyond. The tall one seemed not to
notice her. Caught up in her own thoughts, she stood alone caressing the

could tell by her resolve to face a memory that will never again be real. She

wondered if something equally humorous had happened here a long time ago when
they planted the mimosa and maybe the mailbox and the daffodils out front.

I wanted to approach her but couldn't see my own significance in the bigger
picture, the bigger picture that didn't include me, at least not until now when
both women seemed as unfamiliar to me as I am to them. From nearly fifty yards
away, the taller woman's expression was only as I could imagine it; so I
imagined it peaceful and warm. She turned away from the back of the house
without looking over her shoulder and then followed her companion onto the
trail and then south toward the mission and <st1:country-region w:st="on">

spring blitz brings a recognition or remembrance of things out of the ordinary,
of things raw and exciting, of things likely to happen only once or never at
all outside of fantasy or imagination. The blitz comes attacking the
hibernating self, creating dreamlike persona that refaces itself every spring.
Without the spring blitz, I would be forever trapped here, living without a
complete personality, waiting for something dramatic to happen just enough to
complete me, to finish defining who I am supposed to be. But secretly I feared
becoming a ghost like the artist haunting a familiar place, unable to leave
because I am not yet whole and not yet completely dead. Like the artist, I
feared just waiting here in my living room or my kitchen or my bedroom or in my
hallways and the room upstairs for something that would never happen or for
someone who would never come. I feared waiting forever for something alive to
die, to somewhere make room for me to live again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

no idea what they talked about on their way back to the town square. But I'm
certain they noticed the redbuds and the alders thickening along the creekside.
They may have stopped to pick a few wild blackberries or to photograph a
colorful patch of primrose or baneberry or to admire a muskrat or a colorful
jay or finch. The fresh season is especially generous to travelers unused to
