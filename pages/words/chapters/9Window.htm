is the season of the oboe. Sullen but peaceful, resolute but patient, the
winter has a way of bringing out the best in us, the part we think that no one
else sees, the part of us that we admire secretly the most. The oboe explains
everything about the winter and brings out a thousand shades of gray always
overlooked by a brilliant array of color. It is a shade of gray in a
composition of black and white. The oboe restores to us our grayness; our
ability to be beautiful without color, without freedom; constrained for a time
to fast, to observe ourselves when we have nothing to do, no one to even be
alone with. The winter finally gives us space, and lots of it. It is the time
we are left to ourselves and draw from the experience a new way of seeing, of
not being afraid of what we cannot do, of what we cannot become, of what we may
never experience or feel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

skating in on the shirt-tails of an Indian Summer that evaporates the moment we
begin to enjoy it. The last day of fall has a peaceful kind of sadness bearing
just enough nostalgia to keep away the anxiety and fear of the impending death
and insanity that will come to many of us: that outbreak of cabin fever no more
comfortable than traction. Winter without its own music will surely eat away
every degree of emotional integrity that we think we possess. Cabin fever will
come. Its frustration is expected in the winter before the music changes to
something more suitable to the environment and we are somehow able to squeeze through

the caregiver who may believe that something bountiful will result. But
truthfully, I'd rather just vacuum the floor. The ivy in the kitchen ignores

winter must really stress it, must do some emotional damage, depress the poor
thing, taking away its burgeoning resolve that everything else finds in the
spring. Regardless of how I treat it, the plant just barely survives, it lives
like a dying relative unaware of its own transcendent pain. Mangan's Sister,
when she's frisky with the fever, sneaks up on its willow-like frawns and
attacks them dangling in the air-conditioning blowing like a warmfront across

while sweeping the front porch, I noticed a snail crawling up the door frame.
It had been raining the day before, drizzling for a few moments and then
subsiding for a few moments more. It never rained hard enough or long enough to
thoroughly dampen the porch or for me to even hear it landing on the roof or
dripping from the eaves onto the ferns and ivy around the house. But the
moisture was there in clouds and fog throughout the day and evening. Obviously
the snail got lost in the fog and mistakenly slid up the side of the cement
porch and then up the door frame, looking for a meal or for her nest or simply
trying to find a lookout point from where she could re-orient herself to her
surroundings. She seemed to be climbing up a masthead to the crow's nest,
looking for land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wished I could have helped her. I tried to use my own humanity and wisdom to
guess the snail's objective, to even accomplish it for her if I could. A
vestige of slime marked her path behind her and for a moment I wanted to follow
its lucid slick back to where her journey started, but I wasn't about to pick
her off the door frame and flick her back into the weeds. It looked like a lot
of work just getting up the side of the porch and onto the door frame; a
journey that must have taken her several hours. For me, it would be like
rewriting an entire book because the typeface was too large. Negating a journey
perhaps directed by some sublunary instinct for the snail's own good was from
my perspective sadistic and beyond my ability to understand why nature's force
had lead her to my porch in the first place. But certainly the snail was more
aware of her own predicament and its concurrent dangers than I. But surely, I still
argued, if she'd have only read the weather reports and prepared for the winter
as every other species in the valley, she would have just stayed home this
morning and waited like the rest of us for the spring. I couldn't tell if she
was hungry, tired, sick, lost or perfectly content. Maybe she was just taking a
little stroll in this glorious snail weather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sent her raving out of her snail village to go climbing up my door frame where
the eyes of every crow and grackle in the community could see her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stood against the door and examined her more closely than I have any other

scab that didn't belong there, weighing her down, burdening her while she so
vigorously climbed up the door frame. It was hard not to transpose her logic
and instincts into my own. I couldn't help seeing myself in the same
predicament. She looked like a tiny me carrying thirty bags of groceries up a

finished sweeping and went back into the house to look her up in my field guide
to western forests. It offered me no solace at all; after reading the first
page, the snail became just another bug to me. But then again, I didn't find Human
Being in the field guide at all; we must be different, somehow exempt from the
rest of nature. After an hour I returned to the porch to check on her, to see
if she had changed her mind and returned home where I thought she belonged. But
she was still there, a little higher on the door frame. She had advanced
another foot or so to about eye level and I could look more closely at her
shell, her black slippery body and her hornlike antennae. I could almost see
her face, her expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

her it was a beautiful day. She may have been equally puzzled or disturbed by
my retreating into the house when I ought to have taken advantage of the lovely
weather. I ought to have been sliding up some telephone pole along the highway.
Perhaps cabin fever, the winter fever, didn't affect her at all. Perhaps she
was just enjoying the day, taking advantage of my porch and door frame that
offered her a new challenge or opportunity to see a new vision, to rise out of
the clouds and the fog, to see, to be seen, to exist undaunted by the perils
that everything faces when developing new insights and discovering new
perspectives. She took a beautiful day and glorified it by achieving a goal,
taking a chance and reaching a new destination. Maybe this is why I spend so
much time in the upstairs room, looking through the branches of the mimosa,
trying to change my perspective, to gather new data on which new insights can
preserve me in the dormant winter when the divine madness comes for me. But
when it comes it finds me already well-preserved, contented in what most people
may consider an unusual and unexpected way. The divine madness reminds me of
that gray part of my personality and character that I trust the most, that
brings to mind the sounds of the oboe playing softly in the middle of the day.
It brings to me that peace and quiet that most of us cannot find within life's
frenetic subtext. The winter's melancholy takes away nature and her friendly
beauty. It traps us indoors, but does so that we may develop parts of our character
that need to be alone, to develop the attitude of a snail, to enjoy the
winter's wonderfully gloomy weather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

seasons preceding the winter were elegant, articulate, burlesque in the
beginning and pure in the end. The winter in its own right deserves a little
recognition. The winter must outlive itself and those of us who live within it.
It must make do without mother nature's tender care. The winter must endure its
time being hated, being despised, being misunderstood. The winter is nature's
stand-in treated with contempt and mistrust. The winter is nature's only
reprieve and performs its duty without praise or mercy. The earth deserves some
sick leave. She deserves a vacation. And we must try to make it through the
season without her, without complaining, without spiting the winter that fills
in the best it can with limited daylight, warmth and appreciation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the artist understands. Her disposition shows in the way she brushes her hair
every evening. Without smiling or even looking into a mirror she pulls the
brush slowly, quietly past her shoulders where each hair straightens, stretches
and then relaxes as smooth as a feather. Every lock is the same length and she
must make an effort to pull it around her face. I watch her from the radiator,
anticipating the moment she finishes and parts her hair, opening her face to me
still staring from the other side of her dark brown veil. But she always looks
through me, past me as though I were the ghost. Her disposition is catching. I
reach again for Sister, roll her onto her back and brush her chin and neck with
my fingers parted, passing winter's melancholy on to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I recall limitless outlines of the artist drawing, quietly walking around the
house, paying a special but foreign attention to her own paintings and to the
new mantle clock that plugs into the wall but ticks as though its gears are
unspooling. I've observed her reading in the living room. She props her feet
upon the coffee table and lays back on the old rug. With a pillow from the
armchair under her head she holds a thin book above her&#8212;reading as if she were
up-side-down. Her hands and arms tire quickly and she rolls onto her side.
Unaware of the book, she stares at a wall, into the empty fireplace or at the
haze-covered window. I found her sitting at the dining room table which I have
converted into a desk for the winter. I have watched her there for indefinite
periods examining books and papers I haven't noticed in days. She studies the
layout of the table, muses at the computer and the keyboard without touching
it. She behaves so often as though she were waiting here for someone and has
arrived a few years early.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

outlines reveal her personality, character, charm and youthfulness. But her
voice is a mystery to me as is my melancholy is to her. Aphasia has spread
throughout the valley. The landscape, the house, the artist and myself are
victims of it. A selective forgetfulness has taken hold of us as if we have not
yet recovered from a trauma that keeps us speechless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

notice her more often in these distracted, unfocused occasions when I am not
working or engaged in some household chore or other obligation. She seems to be
lost here, unable to sense a past that was invariably terse and personal and
familiar. It was her home. But she keeps on living in a timeless carelessness.
She and the house regard each other as strangers. A room at the <st1:place
            w:st="on">Inn
    </st1:place> for one and an aesthetic accessory for the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

maybe it is madness, not catastrophe that afflicts us. I think she cannot
speak, therefore she won't. I think she is intriguing, quixotic <i
            style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> real, therefore she is. I can hear
her bare feet in the kitchen, tapping across the linoleum and onto the hardwood
floor in the living room. The room goes quiet when she crosses the rug. The
patter resumes when she reaches the hallway and enters the bedroom. I can hear
Mangan's Sister jumping from the window sill and landing on the floor by the
telephone stand. I can hear her muffled purr while she stretches, her mouth
smack when she wakes from a nap. I can hear the hum of the refrigerator kicking
on and off according to its particular cycle. I can hear the passing blades of
the ceiling fan slowly circling above the coffee table in the living room. And
in between all this silent motion I can hear a sibilant ringing in my head. But
I hear no voice. Every mouth is closed. It must be the fever, the winter
madness that seduces me between the sounds of the ghost, the refrigerator, the
fan and Mangan's Sister.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is a peaceful madness that comes in the winter when I am locked away for so
long. I am not alarmed by its threatening possibilities. It is like being in a
giant city, standing in a building thirty stories high, looking out of a window
at the life below walking along the busy streets, climbing in and out of busses
and taxis, feeling the maddening sounds through your shoes, rumbling like a
hundred trains passing and braking at once. From the hundredth floor of the
towering building, the cadence of a living city cannot make a sound. But if you
listen hard enough and long enough, through the silence, you can hear the oboe
playing something sad but comforting, something incongruent with the busyness
outside but nonetheless natural and friendly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is my nature, I suppose, to display an air of melancholy, to personify what
they call the divine madness. It is an apprehension toward optimism and
jubilance but not toward celebration and fantasy that consigns me. When the
artist's apparition walks outside in the late afternoon once the mist has
burned away, before the sun sets and the clouds change colors, I can see the
light shinning behind her, passing through her linen gown, silhouetting her
figure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have seen how she moves when she turns a corner, when she slides her hand
against the wall as she passes. I have seen the way her shoulders roll when she
tosses a stone into the creek. I have watched her through windows just inches
above her and yet I hear nothing. She sighs, she laughs, she hums, but I cannot
hear her, just her feet passing me, always passing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

within my notes I have written a seduction. When the summer comes and the light
changes and the valley comes to life again I will find the scene while moving
my study back to the mission library. But by then, it will be too late: we will
all by then have recovered and will speak without hesitation and forethought.
Writing will be harder, but speaking will be thoughtlessly remembered. The
poet's mouth will stretch and kiss peace before the oboe finishes its last note
of the winter. Tomorrow I will go back to work and the artist will wait here
for her companion until the end of March, and I can no longer see her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
