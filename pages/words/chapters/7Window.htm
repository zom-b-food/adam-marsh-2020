sleeping- with-the-window-open weather is here, the weather that ripens a
harvest, the weather that is just cold enough to be uncomfortably pleasant just
before it freezes, before it is truly painful. It is the cool before the cold
that stiffens, tightens every muscle causing you to tremble, to stand still,
not bending your knees to sit because your jeans are too cold. That is February
coldfront weather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to winter a taste for optimism. Wordsworth said that our birth is but a sleep

death that winter signifies is nothing but a sleep and a forgetting of the
earth's sublimity. The death that winter brings should be a recollection of things

office and the chapel, the school playground was empty. A draft caught the door
as I opened it and pulled me outside unprepared for the sudden windburst that
kicked up a cyclone of leaves and dust in the playground. A candy wrapper,
colored bits of construction paper and a child's crafted cornucopia was hung up
against the chain link fence, pinned by the wind. The red, yellow and green

Marian, a deli owner, greeted me by name a little more slowly and quietly than
I was used to. Nonetheless, and according to her nature, she handed me a large wedge
of cheese, fresh, she said from a local farm. It was hard for me not to notice
her unusaully sullen mood. Marian is a loquacious middle-aged woman, divorced
with a teenage son and is always more friendly to me than I am to her. Her type

find the bathroom and relieve what they came to relieve; and I'll never see

trouble me as I walked up the porch steps. Only in the fall does it fit in,
does it blend with the other naked trees in the neighborhood. I failed to check

to dry up, a few days after Labor Day. Not until I stopped hearing it tap
against the upstairs window did I realize how much of the summer truly

yellowing stems and stalks of pale grass and hay. The implications of these

her box was filled mostly with Christmas and Easter stuff. Somehow her
oversight obligated me to decorate the house for Halloween as extravagantly as
she would have done for Christmas and Easter. The house has subsequently
celebrated Halloween more devoutly than any other holiday. I almost had a party

resembles the amber tip of a penlight when the battery is weak. The light hangs
on forever it seems before dying out, the energy of the heat consumes all of

But he missed, I think, another part of winter, the secret part that lies low
in the hazy town and countryside west of the mountains. Last winter's
sabbatical took me there to the slopes always gray and dark and mossy. Humpback
whales seemed to rise into clouds from a horizon not clearly seen. A wash of
gray and pasty green, the color of my father's eyes, pursued me into the woods,
followed me on my neighbor's bicycle with a book and a jacket strapped to the
seat. I rode standing on the pedals to an old cemetery to record the names of

was a deserted place: the path to the graveyard, D�rer's study. Still a mile
from the wood, I remember pushing on the pedals clicking against the kickstand

trees. They were drums thumping a pitch apart, playing like a stampede of
ponies far away. Sensuous and angry drums less threatening than a fly became
more frightening the faster I pedaled, the more I imagined the ghosts I had
come to find. Thin rumblings more like a thousand throats swallowing in
succession chased me into the wood. A hypnotic pulsing like a thousand tennis
balls rolling down the stairs or a thousand brushes basting the buckskin bass
pursued me into the moors. And yet I grew anxious for something to touch me,
another living person, an exciting stranger&#8212;a messenger coming to find me. I
could still hear the drumming against the rocks and soft soil while the ponies
tamped upon the misty fjords where they were left to graze years ago on lichen,
botts and saltweed. My secret place was too obscure to bear, to tolerate
without giving in to my imaginary messenger wandering through the moors with
her eyes closed, chasing after the pulse, my pulse, while a thousand throats
swallowed and I pedaled faster away from the beating hearts, wondering which
was hers and which was mine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wintry valley was an aphrodisiac, a penicillin or whatever relieves me. Rushing
through the trees and grass, through deserted, stone buildings and gullies, I
found the secret plots: the gravestones lost within the brush one hundred and
sixty years ago, honored by a passing beetle or fox or woodwren landing for a
rest upon a twig. Not even the ghosts will find me here, I thought; I will lie
in D�rer's deserted study, the hazy valley, waiting for the messenger to find me,
for that new voice to say my name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

imagine that the gargoyles on the balcony would love the old graveyard. Maybe
they go there at night I pretend to investigate the stone markers they so
closely resemble. They want to contact the dead perhaps. They want to know how
close they are to death, how much longer they must live like vampires feeding
on nothing but darkness and freezing solid in the sunlight. Composed of
granite, covered in mold, moss and dirt, the gravestones were readable only
after I rubbed the faces with shave cream so the white foam could seep into the
etching. Once I wiped off the remaining foam I could read the epitaphs of
Narcissa Holmgreen: b1799 - d1850, Nathaniel Angus Bosney: b ? - d1849 and
Jessie Colton who died at age 4 in 1849.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

graveyard had 11 markers that I could find. Most were still standing upright
but a few were broken or lying flat and overcome with blackberry bushes and the
natural litter of the earth that I could not read anything but a few letters.
There may have been more stones but I could not guess where since the
blackberry bushes kept me from certain parts of the grove's center.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

diameter of the graveyard was about 400 feet, the only tree-covered land for
six or seven miles. If the sun ever shines there, I bet it is a spectacular
sight, filtering through the cottonwoods adding layers of texture to the circle
of graves. I wonder how the people died there. From the dates on the stones it
seemed that they had perished in some unrecorded massacre or a sudden outbreak
of cholera and were buried here in the only shady spot within seeing distance.
The trees in 1840 were only saplings, like Jessie Colton. But somehow the trees
survived. God only knows how the blackberries came. Maybe little Darius Bowers:
b1841 - d1849 had some seeds in his shirt pocket. Maybe they were buried with
him still at the bottom of his pocket since the day he had gathered them along
the trailside. Within his coffin they must have found some special mineral that
gave them life in the small boy's heart and rise into the prickly bush bearing
his favorite treat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

weather has come. The days are getting shorter. Even the gargoyles on the
parapet can feel it. They stay out longer at night. They fly higher, always
higher, never going near the sea, always flying above the mission and the
center square where people are always present. They need people for some
reason. They need to know that <st1:country-region w:st="on">

is still alive, that it hasn't changed since the previous night. Every night is
as blue as the next, until the rains start. In between cold fronts, cirrus
clouds stretch like thin muscles in front of the moon never completely
obscuring it, never leaving the strange beasts alone in the utter blackness.
The moon, clouds and sky preserve the night's color and the mysteries that lie

air is just as cool as the balcony. A gobo of the moon shines onto the scrim; a
blue and purple backwash spotted with clouds blows past the projected moon. The
entire theatre possesses that same phosphorous glow of the Melissa Blue and the
bay at Tower Hill. The stage reveals what the mission and the center square so

the two-plex cinema, all entertaining <st1:country-region w:st="on">

one time or another everyone here is a night person. The nights are too
commanding to stay indoors. Moonflowers and other nocturnal plant life opens up
to us here on the way to the box office or along Dakota Creek where a musician
plays an acoustic guitar, oboe or viola for couples passing by. I can hear him
playing from the library balcony on Friday nights before walking home. By the
time I reach my neighbor's hayfield his music has been redubbed by spotted
frogs and crickets: nature's bass and snare. But soon they will stop and the
winter will come. Sweater weather will end, and I will only hear the wind:
nature's whole rest. We will all wait attentively for the first one talking,
the first thoughts passed between species or dimensions. I dream about the
gargoyles coming home early and their visits to the secret graveyard that end
just a few hours sooner and a thousand hours short of Spring.</span><span
