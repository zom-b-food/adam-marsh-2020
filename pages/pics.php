            <h3>A photograph is a meditation...</h3>

            <div id="needtowrap">
                <p>I have always longed to tell the stories of people I photograph. And I have
                    always fostered a style and philosophy that endeavors to illuminate the soul of
                    everything I see. I look for a person's humanity in their expressions complete
                    with the
                    good, bad, but never ugly ;). And in the end, I often discover a true and
                    soulful beauty that reveals a story about everyday people that, hopefully, we
                    can all relate to. I love people, and helping them find this beauty behind the
                    camera is my number
                    one goal. Nothing illustrates the collaboration of art and science better than
                    the art and science of photography. It employs the art of observation and the
                    science of communication. One must see the sublime in the mundane and the
                    extraordinary in
                    the midst of ordinary. And one must communicate through pictures a context of
                    time that can be preserved and remembered forever.</p>
