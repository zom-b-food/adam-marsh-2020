footpath along the creek; I had seen their colorful clothes through the bamboo.
From the artist's window, I watched them pass behind the house. And on my way
to work this morning, I saw a neighbor speed walking, dressed in athletic garb
as new and colorful as the tourists' gift-shop wardrobe. I knew him from the
print shop. At least thirty pounds overweight, he looked entirely out of his
element there on the trail, speed walking in a bright orange and purple jogging
suit still creased from its packaging. He probably got it for Christmas and
only this morning tore off the store's sale's tag. The winter kept him locked
up and it took the summer to coax him outside, to begin a new summer habit. New
Year's resolutions don't begin here until June. The rainy winter postpones a
lot of things and our resolves do not dehibernate until we do. But most of the
time, the path and the creek are mine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

last evening when most folks were clearing the dinner table I walked
undisturbed northward along the creek. Just south of the cemetery, I stopped to
rest upon a giant tree stump nearly four feet high. It was split down its
center to about knee level and then cut horizontally making a rather
comfortable high-backed chair. It faced the creek and up the sloping bank into
a family's backyard. I could not see far beyond the bank's plateau, but aside
from the creek trickling southward, I could hear from the stump a small group
of boys engaged in a football game. Their hollering and thunderous footsteps
rolled down the slope and to the stump where I intercepted it and tried to
watch by climbing onto the stoop and leaning forward almost to the point of
falling off and into the creek. I saw only three boys but heard about six or
seven voices. One boy wore a headband that covered his eyebrows and the tops of
his ears. I'm sure I've seen him and his friends around town but they looked
unfamiliar, behaved differently here in their own environment, their own
element. They were consumed by the game. The boy with the headband was the
quarterback for one of the teams. I could hear them break formation and spread
across the yard, each one hoping for a pass, hoping to make the big play. I
could see more of them as they raced toward the end of the yard. But not
wanting to be seen, I squatted back down upon the stump, rested against its
curved back and listened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

enjoyed being a spy for those several minutes. The unique privilege that only
the invisible have excited me. I was certainly out of my element during the
game, sneaking peeks at the young players now and then and eavesdropping on
their banter, occasional cursing and crude impromptu behavior that boys are
more guilty of than we generally suspect. Not realized in their element, I was
invisible to them; I was comfortable belonging nowhere, belonging only to the space
around me, belonging in a space that could see, hear and feel without being
discovered, without being disappointed in its own transparency and solitude. I
was the proverbial fly on the wall, undaunted and unaffected by the presence of
others around me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

boys played hard, running sporadic patterns in the grass, trying to avoid their
opponents, trying to find that one open spot on the field. A thin, red-haired
boy was the quarterback's favorite target. He always caught the most
misdirected passes and suffered the most brutal tackles but arose almost
immediately after hitting the ground. He was unaffected by the violence of the
game. He was too thin, compact and wiry to feel pain&#8212;there was nothing about
him to hurt: no muscle, fat, gut or mass outside of hard, uncrackable bone.
Always the slowest to rise, the tackling boys congratulated each other on a
fine tackle but said nothing to the artful receiver. But nature now and then
dispensed its ironic mercy as the tackling boys winced more than occasionally from
a bruised neck, arm or shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

played well into the night. The darkness intruded as it always does. And the
red-haired boy dropped more passes and received more scolding for doing so. The
group needed someone to hit and the boy with the headband needed the honor all
leaders receive when a subordinate accomplishes the impossible. But the thin
one never blamed the darkness. The darkness remained unnoticed by everyone but
myself and the thin boy too determined to defy it and overcome his own noble handicap.
The ribbing from his friends seemed more punishing than the tackles. But he
remained stoic I noticed in spite of the responsibility he accepted for
disappointing his abusers. But that is the game boys play I suppose. It is the
game we all play, the game many of us find so engaging. It explains why lovers
cannot love without control and stipulation, why friends cannot befriend
without compromise and condition, why foes cannot fight without embracing
suspicion and retribution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the darkness won, and the boys dispersed. I could not tell where they
disappeared to, I just noticed the silence. But the darkness didn't stop the
creek. It kept tripping over stones and other such traffic in its way southward
past my house, the mission and the town square. The creek traveled in all types
of light: moonlight, starlight, twilight, sunlight. It made no difference and
didn't change the way the creek sounded or the way it traveled, only the way it
revealed itself. It had options after all. Like a miniature army, it carried to
the bay bits and pieces of everything it passed, everything less inimitable
than itself. Without waves or sloping hills pushing it southward, it trickled
slower than I walked. I dropped a twig in its flow and watched it lag behind me.
I waited on it several times as though I were walking a dog, putting up with
its dog-minded distractions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was dark on the trail and I could not see the moon. A floodlight had been
screwed into a pine tree and illuminated the trail for several yards. Bugs of
all make and model were already consumed in its energy. Thousands perhaps, not
one more dominant or prominent than any other, fluttered around the light. Some
buzzed around me, crashed into me, tangled themselves in my hair. Some fell
onto the path and crunched under my feet like the dirtclods in the flower bed
around my mailbox. I tried to avoid them but they were too numerous. I suppose
some suffered under my feet while others drowned in the cool creek. And a
chosen few suffered the ultimate climax: burning into smoke in the middle of
the lamp. For a moment everything seemed to suffer: the boys playing ball, the
piece of stick I tore from a bush and tossed into the creek, the junebugs
unable to free themselves from my hair and my heavy boots. How much happier
we'd all be if the lamp were broken, I thought, if its abusive light were gone
out, if it were solely accountable for everything it punished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lamp removed all romance from the creek. Its lurid charm brought death to the
insects around it and darkened the ambient color that I was used to and had
come to expect. The creek's florid coloratura died in the lamp's copper light,
unable to resound a single note in the electric buzzing and the drumming heads
and shoulders of battling beetles. The entire scene was a mess. Shakespeare's
walking shadows crept from every corner, into the light and against the black
trees; Banquo's nightmare played out that evening along the creek where all
color and tranquility vanished. The lamp was the dead spot along the creek, it
was another of nature's monuments eulogizing a part of itself that encircles
and announces ugliness and despoils the complexion of man and earth's original
designer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

jogged the rest of the way home, washed my face in the kitchen sink with handfuls

head, assured her that all was well and then sat up with her and Annie
Dillard's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i> at
the kitchen table with only the porch light bleeding onto the pages through the
window. Within a chapter, Dillard redefined my entire journey along the creek
and reminded me of the brutality but naturalness of nature. By the time I went
to bed my arrogance had surprised me. I didn't immediately realize that earlier
I had defined happiness for every creature along the creek, that I had
quantified life's purpose for the junebug, the red-haired boy and his friends
and even the green twig I tore from a willow. Yet I didn't stop to wonder that
if the light had been stronger, warmer and more familiar, would it have been
more or less alluring and perilous? Maybe, I wondered, it would have been like
that warm, celestial light we've been told will come to us in death's tunnel
leading to God, leading to everlasting peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recently celebrated its birthday. Local history claims that Russian colonists
originally settled in the valley around 1831, twenty eight years before the
territory became a state. Not long thereafter, the town was officially named
after a sister missionary who fell against a bayonet while trying to stop a
fight among miners on their way to <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">Sacramento</st1:place>
</st1:City>.
The miners made it to <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place>
</st1:State>
after a brief inquiry by the catholic church, the primary authority in the
region. The sister missionary finally made it to heaven; or at least to the
ossuary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
town held a celebration resembling a low-budget fourth of July party. There
were fireworks at night and during the day, the mayor dedicated a bench at the <st1:place

    </st1:country-region>
flags showing 33 stars and marched around the town square and down <st1:Street
            w:st="on">
        <st1:address w:st="on">Knowles Avenue</st1:address>
    </st1:Street> to
the park's gazebo. Mrs. Brandis, from the civic improvement committee, gave a
speech on the pioneers who first walked to the valley in 1836 from <st1:State
            w:st="on">Missouri
    </st1:State>, <st1:State w:st="on">
        <st1:place w:st="on">Illinois</st1:place>

and other points east. She paused in the middle of her tribute to the sister
missionary for whom <st1:country-region w:st="on">
        <st1:place w:st="on">Valencia</st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
is named while the children prepared to finish their march and present to her a
flag and a lei of lilies. A few boys at the back of the procession were
obviously restless and Mrs. Brandis refused to continue until they settled
down. Her marmish pause and the children's restlessness reminded me of the
lyrics to a song I learned in church as a boy. I began humming it quietly to
pass the time, "...and the pioneer children sang as they walked and walked and
walked and walked...." I can remember repeating that phrase forever as a child,
at least for as long as the piano kept vamping the same chord over and over. It
vamped for eons it seemed as did Mrs. Brandis' pause. I felt like I was back in
church, waiting for a flock of five year olds to fold their arms and reverently
face their teacher standing as an example at the pulpit. But there was no piano
at the park to take away the awkwardness of waiting, and Mrs. Brandis',
I'm-teaching-you-a-lesson attitude made the celebration less tributary and more
infuriating.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was appropriate that the mayor dedicated a bench since so many of us felt like
falling into it for as long as the boys continued to fidget or as long as Mrs.
Brandis perpetuated the standoff. I wondered what Sister Valencia Delamort�
would have done if she were there at her roasting. I suspect that she'd be more
inclined to take a nap with the rest of us on the newly christened park bench.
I doubt she'd be as annoyed as was Mrs. Brandis at the children's apparent lack
of respect. But more than likely, I think, it was not respect that the children
lacked but patience. And hopefully one day when they are grown they will
understand the irony of discipline and its rigid duality, and that by then they
will have learned to manage or to at least disguise their impatience. If not, I
dread they will become like Mrs. Brandis&#8212;undeniably the only human in the
valley to terrorize patience and to understand discipline more than people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the ceremony most of us ate hot dogs and drank lemonade, compliments of scout
troop 322, and hung out until dinner time when the banners were taken down and
everybody went home or to the grocery store or to the new golf course in
Eugene. Mrs. Brandis however disappeared readily after her speech; perhaps so
full of devoutness that she headed east to <st1:State w:st="on">

about Sister Delamort� and the other pioneers prompted me to visit the storage
room in the old mission where shelves and tables behaved more like charity drop
boxes holding a variety of memorabilia that the pioneers hauled with them to
the valley. Small tables, chairs and settees, crates and wooden chests filled
with dishes, linens, small family heirlooms, and other personal possessions
came in wagons while the settlers walked beside them. Pack animals generally
carried immediate supplies like food and cookware, guns and ammunition and
other trailside necessities. Some parties walked behind pushcarts laden with
personal valuables and supplies across the great plains and through the Rocky,
Wasatch and <st1:place w:st="on">Cascade mountains</st1:place>. Settlements
along the <st1:State w:st="on">Oregon</st1:State> and Mormon trails were more
like rest stops and provided the pioneers with as much rest and attention as
modern day spectators do for marathon runners by extending cups of water along
the avenues in <st1:City w:st="on">Boston</st1:City> and <st1:State w:st="on">

comparison, and I've since decided that next month after mowing my lawn, I'll
complain less about pushing a wheelbarrow full of grass clippings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Walking
around the storage room is difficult and not always worth the effort. I found
an antique Victrola missing its tuner arm and stylus. It's a pity it couldn't
have been saved before its confinement in the room. Yet even in its depraved
condition, it testified greatly of the sacrifice of those who carried it over
the mountains and may have only destroyed it while finally unloading it from
the wagon. Other antique treasures are buried under boxes of teaching supplies
and religious props dating to the mid seventies. Aside from a few
unrecognizable antiques, most of the stuff in the storage room is donated junk
from locals not willing to pay the dumping fees. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

        style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>On
my second or third visit to the room I found a sterling censer in a cardboard
box on a crate of broken china. The censer was the only thing worth saving from
the box filled with shag-rug tapestries and tie-died dresses and kerchiefs from
the hippie generation. The wadded up clothing and wall hangings of yarn and
plastic beads within the damp box reminded me of the decade's natural
moldiness. For the most part, <st1:country-region w:st="on">
        <st1:place w:st="on">Valencia</st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
at that time, was already beginning to separate from the world. Expatriates
from mainstream society emigrated to the valley, seeking a simpler existence.
But we didn't leave the world because of its politics, nor did we leave as a
matter of protest. We hadn't the energy for social defiance; we hadn't the
savvy for political debate&#8212;we left in order to rest, to retire and to find
anonymity among the history of the valley and the experiences and forgotten art
of its creators.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sterling censer did however keep its religious mystique and now hangs from a
coat rack in the corner of my study; it is one of many items I have recovered
from the storage room and pirated from the church a little old-time spirit and
culture. I don't use the censer any more for incense since the library and the
study already smells rather old and churchy. The censer however is slightly
smaller than a coconut and can hold up to three rolls of quarters, a pack of
gum and the master key to the library, storage room, ossuary and most other
places on church property. But in spite of its current use, I still notice from
time to time while digging for a quarter the musty scent of religion and am
reminded once again of the sister missionary who died for the church, or at
least for her convictions of what it represented. The sacrifices of the
founders are memorable here. Their experiences can be remembered in <st1:country-region

Sister curled herself around my neck and shoulder late that evening while I sat
upstairs against the window. Looking at the trail and drinking my favorite
bedtime toddy, I thought of the massacre going on up the trail around the floodlight.
I considered its necessity as a principle of life and a consequence of the
ultimate experience. The boys playing football, on the other hand, I considered
differently. Their t�te � t�te, playful teasing and battling bodies mimicked
nothing less than one of life's exaggerations confined to a grass lot and a
definitive set of rules more manageable for young boys. Soon enough they'll
become aware of another world burdened with adult responsibilities, conditions
and consequences always more terminal than a bruised neck, arm, shoulder or
ego.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

seems like very living creature in the valley is engaged in its own contest
measuring its own value against its possible conquest by other species having
comparative but opposing objectives. I suspect at times that we are all on the
same journey at some time or another. We choose our destinations daily. We
follow different roads perhaps, sometimes never knowing for certain where they
lead. Sometimes I will travel caring for nothing but the journey; and other
times I will move only concerned with arriving. But however I choose to live or
wherever I choose to go, it will matter little in the end as I lay dying
unconcerned with my past and where my decisions took me. I suspect I'll search
at the end of my journey for the nearest bench. I'll kick off my shoes, lower
my head and stare at my feet, apologizing to them for going the long way and
thanking them for being so patient. I wonder if that day will be the last of
all days. And if there is an afterlife, I wonder if art will be less difficult
to find and experience more easily appreciated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
