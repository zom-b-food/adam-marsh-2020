night I took a walk through the neighborhood and paused on the sidewalk beside
a stranger's house. Through a window of a child's room, I saw a caged mouse
playing on its plastic drums and tubes as though it were expecting to escape. I
moved closer to the window and watched from a hedge the small mouse climb into
a tin wheel and furiously run in place, as the wheel spun faster and faster. I
thought the poor thing would tire or loose its footing and tumble helplessly
within the wheel, or worse, that as it tumbled, he would crush his tiny head
between the wheel and the metal pin that held the torturous contraption to the
cage. But it didn't, and I left the house satisfied with the skills of a pet
mouse that apparently had no other less frustrating desires than to turn a
stupid wheel. Turning its wheel, I thought, must be its only job, its most
fulfilling activity. The purpose of it all, I expect, was to turn the wheel, a
routine no more noble than mine I confessed before turning the corner behind
the old church. The purpose for too many of us, I thought, must be to grow up,
marry and bear replacements who will keep the wheel turning. I argued with
myself the rest of the way home. The moon was lovely, but I ignored it and
thought of the wheel instead. But it never truly rolls, I thought outloud; it
turns above the ground just a decimal point from touching, from really moving.
It's just turning...turning on its drum, its divot, its pin, its hub, its
dowel, its rowel, turning, turning, turning. Generations keep running in place,
playing the odds, paying the dues, making things better, keeping it going,
keeping it turning, letting the wheel keep turning, turning, turning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

does not turn. We keep it still, anchor it in the beach, in the brackish water of
Vero bay. But if I choose, I could sit on my hands upon a dune and watch the
sky, and when the clouds thin, I can raise my head to watch the sea terns
dipping into the waves and coming forth into the sky, back into the light. I
could watch them glide inches above the sea...inches above the seatop at
unfathomable speeds. The littleness of the bird, defiant and inimitable against
the rushing backdrop is equally unfathomable, yet the little bird dismisses it
without a sense of ego or bravado. Mass and energy, sprinting elements of wind
and water exist outside the wheel where ambition and progress is overruled by
freedom and instinct. If I chose to, I could watch the performance from a
bluff, unconcerned with its science as the terns artfully fly undaunted by the
sea's eerie and magnetic charm. I could watch these little birds dance like
ice-skating companions whose familiar touches have been practiced to
extinction. I could observe this foreplay of physics, the mating of balance and
gravity that is today, at this precise moment, more dynamic than ever. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

then suddenly comes the peace. The serenity between the breezes, the incoming
waves, the barking of the gulls. It's like stepping off a treadmill and hearing
its wheels and bearings rub slowly to a stop. And everything is calm. A visual
stillness comes like a meteor getting darker the deeper it moves into space,
the harder the eye strains to see it. It is like a rest in a musical score when
the chorus and the orchestra stops for a beat or two and nothing plays but the
space: the silent part that comes at the end of a foreign film before the
credits when it is quiet and the last scene freezes upon the screen. I could
see and hear that today on Tower Hill if I chose to. It is the last scene when
serenity takes over and the recapitulation finally and really does surrender.
The tern drags a talon along the seatop much like a lazy schoolgirl floating in
a raft downstream dips her foot into the flood, dragging a toe beneath her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

teacher from the elementary school directly below the mission library. We met
one afternoon while passing through the church patico. I suggested that we meet
for a drink to discuss the mystery as to why the patico was always empty, why
the little garden was unable to hold a single visitor. We met there after work
the following day and left immediately for the coast where we settled within a
pocket of dunes for a little wine and conversation. Within a page of dialogue,
we seemed to have run out of things to say. To my relief she asked me to run
back to the car to fetch her sweater although more clothing was something I
didn't think we needed. I hustled to the car without incident, but heading back
in the opposite direction once the errand was half over was more difficult than
I thought. Every dune looked the same and I couldn't remember which one my date
was sitting behind. We didn't see much of each other, in the intimate sense,
that evening or thereafter. Within a half hour or so of searching dozens of
pockets within dozens of dunes, we ended up meeting at the car: one of those
fail-safe measures you issue your children at the mall. She arrived first,
shivering, less romantic than before and somewhat anxious to leave. If she'd
only have raised a flag or something. But what other alibi could I give her

We stopped for a Coke to settle our stomachs and talked that generic talk that
so often does nothing but embarrass and intimidate. We realized before our
sodas were gone that in spite of our initial passing in the patico, our
personalities had since then destroyed any intimate opportunities that we may
have previously imagined. It's funny how places can do that, how they can
mislead you, misguide you, leave you ultimately as empty as they are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

commonly called by the way in which it bounces around patches of indian
paintbrush, beardtongue and figworts. Sometimes they fade into their
environment and cannot be seen until they change flowers. They travel in
schools and when they all take flight, the desire to hold out an arm, to touch
them, is overwhelming. They look like tiny puzzles of orange and white, their
black seams separate them from matter of every color. They are the summers'
favorites. They, and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lycaeides

melissa is one of the most handsome species in the valley. In English it is
called the Orange-bordered Blue or the "Melissa Blue." It is a true
Hesperioidea no more than an inch across that can latch on to my car antenna
and endure the gales I make on my way to the post office or the gas station. By
the end of my errand, it has walked along the windshield wiper and onto the top
of the car. A gentle nudge from the edge of an envelope sends it off into the
breeze and another field or windshield on a lot across the creek. Watching it
settle and then open its wings is like being in a cathedral under a stained-glass
window of vivid silvery purple-blue. Its antennae are thick-ended with short
tips that are hooked like a fish's tooth. The Melissa Blue is the most sought
after winged insect in <st1:country-region w:st="on">
        <st1:place w:st="on">Valencia</st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>'s
meadows and landscaped curbsides. It is not as prevalent here as the Bluebonnet
is in <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State> or the Cormorant is in coastal <st1:country-region
            w:st="on">
        <st1:place w:st="on">Great Britain</st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>,
but the Melissa Blue can be seen now and then in its favorite patches of
alfalfa, crazyweed and wild licorice. Its wings are three times lighter than a
Kleenex and hinge to a sinuous muscle like the cilia of a paramecium. The
wingspan of the Golden Pygmy of Great Britain is only a fifth of an inch. The
Melissa Blue is equally delicate and flies through the fields as undaunted by
the wind as are the terns at Tower Hill. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

wondered since then if there is a human being who can withstand nature without
the aid of his own inventions, or if it would be possible for any human being
to survive beyond the natural forces of nature. After all, nature did not
create my car and the "wind" I produce with it. It makes me wonder why some of
human kind supposes that we are exempt from nature, that it is nature's
ultimate cruelty that we should someday die and decay into the same dirt that
supports the begonia, the bee, the Melissa Blue and the cattails along Dakota
Creek. Will our immortality be more substantive than the foreverness of a
protozoan, a bee or a butterfly? Is it possible that our lot in life was
decided by nature long before the universe exploded and God was born? Have we
all paid for our intelligence with our nakedness and vulnerability? Is our only
lot in life to turn the wheel in our cages, our cities, our houses? And if we
cannot withstand the power of nature and our place within it, I wonder if we
can understand our purpose for sitting on our hands upon a dune, making wings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an element of freedom that comes in the sky while flying. Man will never know
that since he will never fly without the aid of his devices or machines.
Perhaps the hang-gliders around Tower Hill know this better than I. Perhaps
those who push themselves from a bridge or a precipice like the one at Mare's
Point are the only ones who know what the birds and the butterflies know.
Gravity and balance will always appeal to our irrational senses, to the
artistic voice that wants to be the art instead of the artist. These are the
victims and the thrill seekers and the stunt makers looking for ways to defy
physics and logic. But sometimes while sitting on my hands upon a dune,
watching the birds resting in the air, I want to rest with them. I want to know
the hovering angel that comes to my library just as Wagner had known the
quarter rest, the half rest and the whole rest between the oboe and the bass.
His artistry allowed us to stop living and to rest until the silent beat passed
and the score continued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a different element of freedom that the purists believed in, an element of

this freedom and knowledge to Robert Muir who then passed it on to Rachel
Carson who passed it on to an entire generation. They are the ones who come
here to Valencia or to Christmas Island, or Skagway Alaska, Madeira Brazil,
Pooh Corner or the Land of Oz. Real or unreal, there's a precipice someplace
where people go to rest endowed with an element of freedom that we see in
nature, that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> nature. This is where
the orchestra rests and that compelling madness of gravity and balance urges a
few of us to fall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
